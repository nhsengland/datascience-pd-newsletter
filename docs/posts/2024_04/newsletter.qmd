### Now Accessible to All!
After trialing the use of the [NHS Digital GitHub](https://github.com/NHSDigital){target="_blank"} to aid in the creation of the newsletter, it has now been officially moved to the publically accessible [NHS England GitHub](https://github.com/nhsengland){target="_blank"}. 

We strongly encourage contributions to the newsletter from all our colleagues, which can be submitted through [clicking here](https://github.com/nhsengland/datascience-pd-newsletter/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=suggest-some-newsletter-content-.md&title=){target="_blank"} or any of the "Contribute" buttons around the site.

### Mentoring Scheme Expression of Interest
The Professional Development Function Team are investigating the interest in starting up a Mentorship Scheme between senior and junior NHS Data Science colleagues.

[Mentorship benefits both parties](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/professional-development/mentoring/benefits-of-a-mentoring-relationship.page){target="_blank"}: mentees are provided with guidance from someone who has once been in their shoes and mentors gain insights from a new perspective, and gain experience in staff management and development.
If you are interested in becoming a mentor **and/or** mentee, please fill out the [expression of interest form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=slTDN7CF9UeyIge0jXdO45Vp0C6IOYJOjBrGZlr3xANUMkRSNTg1UElOVUJXRzJaS1VGQklPMUY1Ti4u){target="_blank"}.

### Data Science Discussions 
<center>

![Data Scientists discussing a fun topic over coffee, building relationships and expanding their knowledge base](DS_Discussion.png)

</center>
On Thursday 11th April we had our first Data Science discussion, hosted by Will Poulett. Data Science Discussions are a new event, focussed on peer to peer discussions on a broad range of Data Science topics. For this discussion Will asked everyone attending to research a future application of AI that interested them, and also consider how it could be later applied to healthcare. The discussion began with Will presenting his case: [Project CETI](https://www.projectceti.org/){target="_blank"}, who are applying advanced machine learning and state-of-the-art robotics to listen to and translate the communication of sperm whales. Check out his slide deck [here](https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/msteams_2768a1/Shared%20Documents/FT%20-%20Professional%20Development/PD%20Events/Data%20Science%20Discussions?csf=1&web=1&e=Tbm3Gq){target="_blank"}. We then broke up into smaller groups to further discuss his case and our own. 

The Professional Development Functional Team hope to hold Data Science Discussions monthly. If you have an area of Data Science you're interested in sharing, and encouraging others to look into too, please [contact us](mailto:datascience@nhs.net) to host a session! Most of the session is held in break out rooms, and so all you need to do is spark discussion.

### RAP Drop In Sessions (Now on Tuesdays)

The RAP Squad hold a [weekly drop in session on Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19:meeting_NGE5Mjc5ZGQtYjJkZi00OGQ4LWJmYmMtOGIxYzI3NWQ3NWZi@thread.v2/0?context=%7B%22Tid%22:%2237c354b2-85b0-47f5-b222-07b48d774ee3%22,%22Oid%22:%226a6e419b-5da0-48cb-854e-e7cca39c57e2%22%7D){target="_blank"},**Tuesdays 10-11am**, for anything and all things RAP (Reproducibile Analytical Pipelines).
