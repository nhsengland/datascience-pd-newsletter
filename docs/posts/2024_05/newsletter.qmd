### [Analysis without Data](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/analysis-without-data-tickets-895208000227?aff=odcleoeventsincollection){target="_blank"}
**Tuesday 21st May, 12-1pm, Online**

This session outlines work by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ)'s Better Outcomes through Linked Data (BOLD) programme Homelessness Pilot colleagues in Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). The Better Outcomes through Linked Data programme aims to demonstrate the benefits of linked data across government. In DLUHC‚Äôs Homelessness Pilot Team, our challenge was a lack of full data access for sensitivity reasons. To overcome this, we developed a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) for our offending and repeat homelessness projects. For the rough sleeping and drug treatment project, we took a pragmatic approach to writing a report using only aggregated data that was suppressed.

We shall talk about our approaches, including constructing dummy data, modular coding using Quarto (an alternative to RMarkdown) and robust statistical methods such as trimmed means.

### [Using Data Science and AI to transform delivery in the prison system](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/using-data-science-and-ai-to-transform-delivery-in-the-prison-system-tickets-885509080497?aff=odcleoeventsincollection){target="_blank"}

In the Prison Data Science team, we aim to support operational decision-making by developing and deploying innovative data science tools.

In this session, we will show examples of how we've used data science and AI to transform processes within prison services"

Data is a major part of our everyday lives, and shapes many of the decisions we make ‚Äì as well as the decisions that are made about us ‚Äì whether we know it or not. We believe that everyone should have a seat at the table when it comes to data, and that is the guiding principle behind our core values: to be collaborative, open and inclusive. So, we invite you to be part of the conversation by joining us and our event partners at a London Data Week event.
