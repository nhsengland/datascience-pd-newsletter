# Events
 </div>

Lots of exciting things coming up! See the [full calendar here](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=861745){target="_blank"}, and a small selection below.

### [Getting started with open LLMs](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/getting-started-open-llms){target="_blank"}
**Wednesday 9th April, 10:00 - 12:00. The Alan Turing Institute (London)**

This interactive session will introduce participants to open large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate how to apply them effectively in research and real-world scenarios.

We'll explore essential tools and workflows using platforms like Hugging Face and Ollama, covering model setup, execution, and fine-tuning for various applications.

By the end of the workshop, you'll gain hands-on experience and a solid foundation to integrate open LLMs into your own projects.

Please email RDrysdale@turing.ac.uk to reserve your spot.

### [How AI is shaping journalism and journalism is shaping AI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/how-ai-shaping-journalism-and-journalism-shaping-ai){target="_blank"}
**Friday 11th April, 17:00-19:15, The Royal Institution of Great Britain 21 Albemarle Street, London W1S 4BS**

AIâ€™s role in journalism goes beyond efficiencyâ€”it shapes content creation, mediates disputes, and helps mitigate bias. At the same time, it raises critical concerns about factual accuracy, bias amplification, and the distinction between AI-generated and user-generated content. This session will explore the far-reaching implications of AI-driven content creation, examining how these decisions influence public trust in journalism.


### [Supremacy - Data Ethics and Society Reading Group](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/dataethics/1549481/r/nhsteams){target="_blank"}
**Tuesday 29th April, 12:00-14:00, Online**

Join us at the Data Ethics & Society Reading Group to discuss Supremacy by Parmy Olson. 

ðŸ‘‹ We will be holding two sessions over two weeks. The sessions will each focus on a different section of the book- but if you can't make the one you want to come to, we can still guarantee a great conversation! [Read more about our changes in our recent Data in Government blog post.](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2025/02/17/data-ethics-and-society-join-the-conversation-in-2025/){target="_blank"}

The event is FREE to attend, but places are limited so please sign up to reserve your spot! (Registration closes on Friday 18th April at 17:00)

### [LSE: The power of data: ethics, politics, and public interest](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Events/2025/05/202505081830/data-ethics-politics-and-public-interest?_gl=1*rwgszb*_gcl_au*MTc0NDU0NDcyNC4xNzM4NTkyNjk3*_ga*MjE2MDg0MDMzLjE3Mzg1OTI2OTI.*_ga_LWTEVFESYX*MTc0MDk5NDcxNS42OS4xLjE3NDA5OTgzNzQuMjkuMC4w){target="_blank"}
**Thursday 8th May, 18.30-20.00, In-person and online public event (Auditorium, Centre Building)**

Data profoundly influences all of our lives and the social, economic and political systems that govern them. Everywhere we turn we are creating increasing amounts of data that powers decision-making algorithms and shapes our future. It is however important to remember how partial and biased data can be given the priviledged position it has in the perception of absolute truth. 

This event will discuss important questions around the role of data science in understanding and shaping the public interest, from access to information to civic participation and business development to democratic processes.


### [DS: Game On 2025](https://datasciencefestival.com/event/dsf-game-on-2025/){target="_blank"}

# Population and Person Insights (AnalystX DS Huddle)
</div>


Recently, the Data Science Community for Health and Care organised a talk with the Popuation and Person Insights (PaPI) team at NHS England. The PaPI project aims to review, improve, and update the risk stratification models used in PaPI dashboards. These dashboards provide critical insights into health and care services by analysing person-level linked data, including the National Bridges to Health Segmentation Dataset.
