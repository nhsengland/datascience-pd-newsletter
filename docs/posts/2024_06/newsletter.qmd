### [London Data Week 2024](https://londondataweek.org/){target="_blank"}
**1st-7th July 2024, Online and in person**

London Data Week is a city-wide, distributed festival of events focusing on all things data. Data is a major part of our everyday lives, and shapes many of the decisions we make ‚Äì as well as the decisions that are made about us ‚Äì whether we know it or not. We believe that everyone should have a seat at the table when it comes to data, and that is the guiding principle behind our core values: to be collaborative, open and inclusive. So, we invite you to be part of the conversation by joining us and our event partners at a London Data Week event.
