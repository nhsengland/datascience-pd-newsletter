  ### How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?

  ### Once you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?

  ### What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you're particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?

  ### If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?

# Analyst X Data Science Huddles reborn!
</div>

Recently, the Data Science Community for Health and Care organised a talk on exploring associations in survey data with machine learning and tidymodels. The talk compared using two different machine learning algorithms to explore the results of the General Practice Patient Survey,  a national publicly-available dataset.

# Analyst X DS Huddle: Building the NHSRwaitinglist package 
</div>
**22nd of July 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online**

The Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for July! The talk will cover building the NHSRwaitinglist package. Have a read of the abstract below:

Building R packages, or Python libraries, is a great way to share and disseminate your code. The process forces you to think about the ‘productionising’ your code, the reproducibility of element, efficiency and the documentation of your code. Interaction with users of a package helps to identify issues, and open coding can encourage communities to fix these issues. This talk will share some of the principles of package building in R, including building functions, documenting functions, unit testing, use of GitHub and releasing a package to CRAN, the most well-known package repository. We will discuss the principles used in building the NHSRwaiting list package, a package to apply calculations and principles from queuing theory to NHS waiting list analysis. This package allows the calculation of target waiting times, understanding queue load, relief capacity required to meet target waiting times, and simple simulation of queues.

We have added this event to [our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=1253649){target="_blank"}, where you can find the calendar invite to access the event.

# Looking for an interesting read?
</div>

The Nature Journal has a paper on [A framework to assess clinical safety and hallucination rates of LLMs for medical text summarisation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01670-7){target="_blank"}. 

The paper looks at how the fidelity between LLM outputs and ground truth information is vital to prevent miscommunication that could lead to compromise in patient safety, and proposes a framework to assess and evaluate these errors.

A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF EVENT 

### [ONS Bringing Data to Life Series: Population Statistics System webinar 2025](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/population-statistics-system-webinar-2025-tickets-1335026342729?aff=ebdsoporgprofile&_gl=1*z35uuu*_up*MQ..*_ga*OTQ0Mzg3ODEuMTc1MDM0MTEyOQ..*_ga_TQVES5V6SH*czE3NTAzNDExMjkkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTAzNDExMjkkajYwJGwwJGgw){target="_blank"}
**Tuesday 8th July, 11:00 - 12:00, Online**

This latest webinar in the series - 'The Population in Numbers - what's changing?' is an opportunity to hear about the newest developments and changes in demographic data and how your feedback has shaped our approaches. We aim to provide insights into the production of demographic statistics, as well as what we will publish for mid-2024. As always, there will be a Q&A session with statisticians, and we hope you can join us. You can post your questions via [Slido](https://www.slido.com/){target="_blank"} ahead of the event using #7709.

The MS Teams link to join the event will be sent to all registered attendees 24 hours before the event.

If you have any questions about the event, please email: pop.info@ons.gov.uk.

The session is free and a ticket is required.

### [ONS Bringing Data to Life Series: Global journeys: estimating international migration](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/global-journeys-estimating-international-migration-tickets-1335412357309?aff=ebdsoporgprofile&_gl=1*7ij2oc*_up*MQ..*_ga*OTQ0Mzg3ODEuMTc1MDM0MTEyOQ..*_ga_TQVES5V6SH*czE3NTAzNDExMjkkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTAzNDExMjkkajYwJGwwJGgw){target="_blank"}
**Tuesday 22nd July, 16:00 - 17:00, Online**

Migration figures are often in the headlines—but what do the numbers really show?

In this next Bringing data to life webinar, we will explain how we estimate the number of people entering or leaving the UK, how people move between regions and devolved nations, and some of the reasons people move. Plus, we’ll explore the key terms, data sources, and what the stats do (or don’t) tell us about UK migration patterns.

We’ll also be joined by a guest speaker to better understand how migration statistics can inform public policy and improve the lives of individuals and communities in the UK.

Whether you’re curious about why people move, the nationalities of those moving in and out of the UK, or just want to know how we estimate the real numbers behind migration, this interactive webinar is for you—no prior knowledge required.

The session is free and a ticket is required.

### [Big Data LDN](https://www.bigdataldn.com/en-gb.html){target="_blank"}
**Wednesday 24th - Thursday 25th September, All Day, London**

Big Data LDN is the UK’s leading free to attend data, analytics and AI conference & exhibition.

The two day event is a hub for the Data Community to learn and share best practice, build relationships and find the tools needed to develop an effective data-driven business.
