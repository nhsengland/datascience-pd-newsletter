The event is FREE to attend, but places are limited so please sign up to reserve your spot! (Registration closes on Friday 18th April at 17:00)

*Please note this event is for Public Sector workers only*

### [LSE: The power of data: ethics, politics, and public interest](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Events/2025/05/202505081830/data-ethics-politics-and-public-interest?_gl=1*rwgszb*_gcl_au*MTc0NDU0NDcyNC4xNzM4NTkyNjk3*_ga*MjE2MDg0MDMzLjE3Mzg1OTI2OTI.*_ga_LWTEVFESYX*MTc0MDk5NDcxNS42OS4xLjE3NDA5OTgzNzQuMjkuMC4w){target="_blank"}
**Thursday 8th May, 18.30-20.00, In-person and online public event (Auditorium, Centre Building)**

Data profoundly influences all of our lives and the social, economic and political systems that govern them. Everywhere we turn we are creating increasing amounts of data that powers decision-making algorithms and shapes our future. It is however important to remember how partial and biased data can be given the priviledged position it has in the perception of absolute truth. 

This event will discuss important questions around the role of data science in understanding and shaping the public interest, from access to information to civic participation and business development to democratic processes.

### [DS: Game On 2025](https://datasciencefestival.com/event/dsf-game-on-2025/){target="_blank"}

### [Pint of Science 2025](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/pint-science-2025){target="_blank"}
**Tuesday 20th May, 18:30 - 21:30. Prince Albert Pub, 163 Royal College Street, London, NW1 0SG**

We're told AI is taking an increasingly important role in decision-making, but what does this really mean? And how should we, the people, respond to this? Understanding how AI is *really* being used for prediction and decision-making is the best tool for interpreting the daily flow of AI news. Three researchers from the Alan Turing Institute will take to the stage to help. We'll hear how AI is being used in the real world and how it relates to the big things in life: health, travel safety and (most important of all) the weather. Plus join in with our annual Big Quiz of AI! 

### [Health Data Science Seminar Series](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/health-data-science-seminar-series-tickets-1329649059129?aff=ebdsoporgprofile&_gl=1*90qvwn*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTkyMDUyNDM4NC4xNzQ1ODI4MjAy*_ga_TQVES5V6SH*MTc0NTgyODIwMS4xLjAuMTc0NTgyODIwMS4wLjAuMA..){target="_blank"}
