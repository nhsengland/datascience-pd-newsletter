# Probabilistic Data Linkage in NHS England Goes Open Source!
</div>

The Data Linkage Hub has been developing a probabilistic data linkage pipeline to enhance the quality of data linkage in the NHS. We’re excited to share that the first iteration is now openly available on [Github](https://github.com/nhsengland/NHSE_probabilistic_linkage){target="_blank"}!
 
Each stage of the pipeline has been shaped by extensive research into best practices, rigorous testing on samples of the real data, feasibility assessments of computational demands, and thorough evaluation. Our approach is incremental, with planned iterative improvements to ensure the highest standards of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.
 
While this pipeline is not yet in use, it represents the foundation of what we plan to deploy within the Federated Data Platform (FDP). Our next step is to quality assure the pipeline, refining it further before implementation.

If you’d like to learn more, visit our [website](https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/our_work/data-linkage-hub/linkage-projects/better-matching/){target="_blank"} or [get in touch](mailto:jonathan.laidler1@nhs.net){target="_blank"}!

# Events
</div>
Lots of exciting things coming up! See the [full calendar here](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=861745){target="_blank"}, and a small selection below.

### [An Alan Turing Institute workshop on AI Ethics and Governance in Practice programme](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/publicsectoruk/1564159/r/nhs){target="_blank"}
**Thursday 27th February, 14:00-15:00, Online**

This workshop will introduce the AI Ethics and Governance in Practice programme developed by experts of The Alan Turing Institute’s Ethics and Responsible Innovation theme. 

This programme provides public sector organisations with the Process-Based-Governance (PBG) Framework, a structured framework to put ethical values and practical principles into practice across the AI project lifecycle. It is an integral part of the UK’s National AI Strategy and expands on the UK Government’s official Public Sector Guidance on AI Ethics and Safety.


NB: This event is only available to public sector employees

### [Statistical Methods for Health Equity Webinar: Catalina Vallejos (University of Edinburgh)](https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/event-details/statistical-methods-for-health-equity-webinar-catalina-vallejos-university-of-edinburgh){target="_blank"}
**Thursday 6th March, 16:00-17:00, Online**

Catalina will talk about "Using Routine Healthcare Data to Predict Future Health," exploring how electronic health records (EHR) can be leveraged to identify individuals at risk of adverse health events and improve patient outcomes. She will also discuss her work on SPARRAv4, a risk prediction tool soon to be deployed across Scotland to support primary care interventions.


### [Rethinking good technology: feminism, AI and ethical futures](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Events/2025/03/202503111830/feminism-AI-and-ethical-futures){target="_blank"}
**Tuesday 11th March, 18:30-20:00, Online and In-Person (Old Theatre, Old Building, LSE, London)**

What does it mean for technology to be ‘good’ in an age dominated by AI? Can a feminist perspective help guide us towards more ethical digital futures? 

In this event Eleanor Drage talks about HEAT, a somewhat anarchic regulation tool that takes a feminist approach to helping companies meet the EU AI Act’s obligations. The toolkit has been developed as part of a project led by Drage, which is committed to an in-depth response to regulation that goes beyond mere compliance by working towards a pro-justice and sustainable future with AI. 


### [AI UK 2025](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/ai-uk-2025){target="_blank"}
**Monday 17th - Tuesday 18th March, All Day, London**

Hosted by The Alan Turing Institute, AI UK is an in-depth exploration of how data science and AI can be used to solve real-world challenges. Our diverse programme was thematically structured around the latest innovations from across the AI ecosystem. With a broad range of interactive content, it covers the latest thinking on fundamental AI, digital twins, algorithmic bias, AI ethics – and much more.

*NB: This is not a free event*

### [An overview of causal machine learning methodology in Electronic Health Records (EHR)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/overview-causal-machine-learning-methodology-electronic-health-records-ehr){target="_blank"}
**Wednesday 19th March, 12:00-13:00, Online**

Dr Maurice O’Connell will give a talk on current work with Dr Matthew Sperrin and the DynAIRx team in the area of statistics and causal inference and causal machine learning. 

Maurice will talk about causal inference methodology development applied to electronic health records in the areas of deprescribing or continuing/initiating medications in individuals and populations with polypharmacy and multimorbidity and selecting individuals with polypharmacy and multimorbidity for structured medication reviews. 


### [DS: Game On 2025](https://datasciencefestival.com/event/dsf-game-on-2025/){target="_blank"}
**Saturday 17th May, All Day, London**

Join us for our 11th festival, DSF Game On 2025! Top tech speakers, incredible partners and a thriving community, all completely free. 

The ballot is open for those wanting a chance to get tickets to DSF's Game On 2025. Click through the link above to find out how to apply, and the (free) tickets to those successful will be sent out in April.

There will be a mixture of talks featured at the festival, covering all things data (science, engineering, etc) and at a variety of technical levels. You can view last years playlist on [YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwzX3WM0AfxopbhVhGCA373Xk-7wNhLfq){target="_blank"} to get an idea of the talks at the events.


### [Big Data LDN](https://www.bigdataldn.com/en-gb.html){target="_blank"}
**Wednesday 24th - Thursday 25th September, All Day, London**

Big Data LDN is the UK’s leading free to attend data, analytics and AI conference & exhibition.

The two day event is a hub for the Data Community to learn and share best practice, build relationships and find the tools needed to develop an effective data-driven business.

**The Call For Papers closes on 14 March** and all applicants will be notified by the end of April whether their talk has been accepted. [Find out more here.](https://www.bigdataldn.com/en-gb/blog/event-news/call-for-papers-2025.html){target="_blank"}

# Knowledge Sharing

### DS AnalystX Huddles - Recordings Available

If you are on the mailing list for this newsletter [(sign up!)](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=slTDN7CF9UeyIge0jXdO48pr_29hyJFKpCZ7SYYvjeFUNUVPMUk0STlDRlJMNklIWEI3V0NZVTZXVS4u&route=shorturl){target="_blank"} you should also be receiving invites to our monthly(-ish) Data Science AnalystX Huddles. These are a way to learn about projects and tools used in healthcare data science across the community (in fact if you'd like to present at one just [drop us an email!](mailto:datascience@nhs.net))

We record these sessions in order to preserve the knowledge and anyone who couldn't make it can catch up in their own time - you can find these recording on our FutureNHS site (free account needed to access). Most recently we had NHS England Senior Data Scientist Kenneth (Kin) Quan tell us about his experience working with OpenSafely to conduct a project on producing up to date ADHD statistics using primary care data. Kin demonstrated how OpenSafely uses dummy data to help researchers write code to produce outputs, which is then executed inside a safe environment and the results returned.

### CodeCarbon

It's well known that LLM's such as ChatGPT use a lot of energy, with estimates varying widely from 5 to 200+ times more energy than a Google search. With the popularity of LLM's for everyday use growing, the total energy consumption is rising. Being aware of the energy consumption of your code is not only more important than ever, it is also easier than ever to do so.

[CodeCarbon](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/){target="_blank"} is a [open-source](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon){target="_blank"} Python package designed to help you estimate the carbon footprint of computing tasks, particularly for machine learning and other high-performance computing workloads. It does this by estimating your hardware electricity power consumption (GPU + CPU + RAM) and applying to it the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done. More is explained about this calculation in the [Methodology section](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/methodology.html){target="_blank"} of the documentation.

Add this (or any other tracker you know of!) to your next pipeline and start taking steps toward more sustainable computing.
