# Analyst X DS Huddle: Dual Project Showcase 
</div>
**23rd of September 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online**

The Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for September! The session will include two talks: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow, and Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare. 

<u>Abstract: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow</u>

Poor admitted non-elective patient flow is a major issue for many acute trusts. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a useful tool for modelling patient pathways. This project used DES to model patient flow for non-elective admissions. The model was used to investigate how reductions in inpatient length of stay, non-criteria to reside, additional escalation beds and fluctuations in demand impact waits for admission in ED. The model allows testing of ad hoc scenarios, via a user-friendly streamlit app, and has also been used to provide evidence-based targets for inpatient length of stay and informed discussions about relevant flow metrics. In this talk I'll discuss the model, how it works and some of the insights from the project and happy to answer any questions or receive any suggestions you may have!

<u>Abstract: Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare</u>

The current methods used for data linkage or indexing in the healthcare industry follow deterministic algorithms that are not transparent to the end users and with often sub-optimal outcomes. Our work focuses on building and implementing a probabilistic algorithm that improves quality as well as explainability of the linkage. In this project we have used Splink, a UK Ministry of Justice probabilistic linkage Python package, to build a pipeline that links any health data set to the Personal Demographics Service (PDS), a dataset containing information about all patients registered to a GP in England, which acts as our linkage “spine”.


We have added this event to [our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=1253649){target="_blank"}, where you can find the calendar invite to access the event.

# The Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme
</div>

The [Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme](https://hsma.co.uk/){target="_blank"} teaches public sector analysts, clinicians and managers how to use data science and operational research techniques, as well as supporting them to apply these techniques in their organisations.

The full HSMA course experience is provided free of charge to people working in health, social care and policing organisations in England.

The full HSMA experience is a live, 15-month programme with two distinct phases: a 6 month training phase where participants learn the Python programming language, and a 9 month project phase where participants are supported to produce their own project using the new skills they have learned.  

Recently, two NHS England Data Scientists completed the HSMA course and have written a [blog post about the course](https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/articles/2025/06/27/hsma-waiting-lists/){target="_blank"} and their [project](https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/our_work/hsma-wlmds/){target="_blank"}. Have a read of the exciting things they got up to!  

**Interested in taking part in the next cohort?** [Sign up to their mailing list](https://hsma.co.uk/#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20interested%20in%20being%20kept%20up%20to%20date%20with%20our%20plans%20for%20the%20next%20round%20of%20HSMA%20via%20our%20mailing%20list%2C%20please%20drop%20us%20an%20email.){target="_blank"} to keep up to date with their plans for next years HSMA course. They hope to launch HSMA 7 in mid 2026.

# Events
</div>
Lots of exciting things coming up! See the [full calendar here](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=861745){target="_blank"}, and a small selection below.

### [AI and Defence for Maritime: Breakfast Briefing](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/ai-and-defence-maritime-breakfast-briefing){target="_blank"}
**Wednesday 17th September, 09:30 - 11:30, IET London: 2 Savoy Place, London,**

The Alan Turing Institute’s Sustainability Mission is hosting a cross-cutting event with the aim to bring together a range of individuals across industry, government, and academia to discuss Artificial Intelligence (AI) in maritime.  The focus of this event will be to break down silos, and foster communication across a diverse group of people (regulators, insurers, developers, users), and throughout the AI lifecycle. We will explore the current state of AI in relation to defence across the maritime sector.

If you would like to learn more about how AI can be used within the Maritime sector for defence, and how attackers can use AI against maritime technology, come along to hear from experts in the field and network with likeminded individuals over some breakfast!

This is a free workshop event and requires you to register your interest.
