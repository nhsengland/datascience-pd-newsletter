### [Exploring associations in survey data with machine learning and tidymodels: AnalystX DS Huddle](event link){target="_blank"}
**17th of June 2025, 13:30 - 14:30, Online,*

Supervised machine learning can be used to understand the factors associated with a result or outcome. In this huddle we will compare using two different machine learning algorithms to explore the results of the General Practice Patient Survey, a national publicly-available dataset. What can supervised learning tell us about factors that are associated with overall patient satisfaction? And how can using different algorithms for the same machine learning task strengthen the quality and robustness of our findings? R and the tidymodels collection of packages will be used to show how different models can be applied to the same dataset with minimum fuss, though the approach will also be of interest to users of Python and other programming languages. This work continues to evolve, and constructive feedback is very welcome!
