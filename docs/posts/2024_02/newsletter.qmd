#### <u>**Your Professional Development** - Job Descriptions </u> 

When preparing for future career opportunities here at NHSE, it's a good idea to understand the job descriptions for each role you hope to apply for. 

Take a look at the [current data science job descriptions saved on Confluence](https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/DAT/Data+Science+Job+Descriptions){target="_blank"} which detail the requirements and expectations for the various roles we may look to recruit for in the team. These will be used for recruitment in the immediate future.

Familiarising yourself with these specifications can help you shape your professional development plans and tailor the training opportunities you seek out.

Please note that in the longer term these job descriptions may change to be aligned to the [National Competency Framework](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=31311216) and this will be communicated to the team.
