#### <u>**Competency Framework** – zooming into...Delivery</u> 

As we adjust to delivering in the new team structure; using potentially unfamiliar tools like Confluence, JIRA and DevOps, getting to grips with new projects and new stakeholders, it’s the perfect time to refresh our understanding of what makes good delivery. 

Delivery is the translation of the insights we produce into actionable outcomes. Keeping a delivery-focussed mindset is key to achieve value for money and improve lives for service users. Without it, we cannot fulfil our mission to drive the digital transformation of the NHS! 

Delivery comes in different shapes and sizes, whether it's being accountable for your own tickets or ensuring your team is focused on the top priorities – each of us play our part.  

Check out these top tips from our [Competency Framework](https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/DAT/Data+Science+Competency+Framework){target="_blank"}❗ :

- Break down complex objectives into clear tasks to deliver incremental value with each iteration 
-	Regularly sync-up with stakeholders to understand priorities and manage delivery expectations 
-	Be a role model to others by demonstrating a focus on delivery, whilst being open to new ideas and continuous improvement
