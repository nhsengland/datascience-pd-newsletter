# Competitions and Challenges
</div>
## British Heart Foundation Kaggle Competition
Got a competitive edge but a heart of gold?

The British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre have set up a Kaggle competition, in collaboration with researchers from the ition on Kaggle The University of Edinburgh. The challenge aims to assess whether artificial intelligence/machine learning can be used to identify and classify disorders of heart rhythm from synthetic ECG images which have been created to incorporate common artefacts.

The top scoring teams will be invited to participate in a British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre webinar about the challenge and the best performing will be invited to present their results at the British Cardiovascular Society (BCS) meeting in June 2025. Participation in these activities will require code sharing.


Find out more information and how to enter [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bhf-data-science-centre-ecg-challenge). 
This competition is currently open and runs until Monday 16th of December 2024.

## Gandalf Game
 
Test your LLM prompt skills by tricking Gandalf into revealing the secret password for each level. Each level gets progressively harder, with Gandalf first just giving the password to anyone that asks and later more creative approaches are needed. 

Played before? There's new adventures! Try Reverse Gandalf, where you tell Gandalf how to defend against password seeking users.

You can check it out here: [Gandalf Wizard AI](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/intro){target="_blank"}

## AI vs Human: Who wrote it best?

Can you tell when something has been written by a machine? Can you write like a machine?

Check out [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/){target="_blank"}, a free online AI checker which estimates its confidence that the text you input is or isn't AI generated. Think you can fool it? Try writing a short paragraph in the style of ChatGPT, and see if you can get it to think what you've written was really written by an LLM. Or flip the script: give your favourite LLM prompts to see if it can produce text that passes as human.
