### [Making health data resources discoverable through the Health Data Research Gateway](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/making-health-data-resources-discoverable-through-health-data-research-gateway){target="_blank"}
**Tuesday 12th November, 13:30-14:30, Online**

The Health Data Research Gateway (the Gateway) is a central location to discover health data and other resources vital for research. To date, more than 850 descriptions of datasets (metadata) from 70+ data custodians have been uploaded to the Gateway, along with 2500+ registered users and over 1000 data uses added to the Gateway data use register.

Throughout the last year, the HDR UK Technology Team has been working on a major new version of the platform. This presentation will outline how the Gateway’s new functionality will help users discover, explore and access health and health-related data, software and research analysis, publications, diseases, phenotypes and other shareable resources.


### [NHS RPySOC 2024 Conference](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/nhs-r-nhs-pycom-open-source-conference-nhs-rpysoc-2024-2024-ticket-for-in-person-attendance-on-thursday-21-november-2024/){target="_blank"}

# Data Science Discussion: Professional Development Edition
</div>

![](dsd_header.jpg)

Last month we ran another Data Science Discussion, an event where we have a host prepare a topic for discussion and then we split into breakout rooms to allow more people to have their say. These discussions aren't recorded, we want to make everyone feel as comfortable as possible to discuss their thoughts and ideas on whatever topic we are talking about.

Most recently our discussion focussed on professional development in our current roles, and how we can support others to take advantage of the opportunities they have.

One discussion point that came up in a few groups was the difference between purposeful development time versus just doing the job and where the line is drawn between them. It was felt that a lot of the work we do involves researching and learning about different techniques and methods, and that this could really also be considered professional development. 

A theme that also came up across groups was the lack of time available for dedicated professional development for topics and areas that are separate from the day to day work. A lot of people felt like they had limited time for self-directed study, and that getting the job done took priority which led to professional development taking a back seat. In order to mitigate this, people suggested blocking out calendar time in advance in order to pre-book learning time, although sticking to this can be hard if you're busy.

We had members from various NHS teams present at this discussion and there was also a definite split, with some teams feeling like they were allowed a lot more time and were encouraged to take development opportunities more than others. This highlighted a bit of a difference in team culture, and there was discussion about how those who are alloted more time could support those without.

The most engaging discussion point? Whether a hot dog is a sandwich. We're still split on it.

# Competitions and Challenges
</div>

## British Heart Foundation Kaggle Competition
Got a competitive edge but a heart of gold?

The British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre have set up a Kaggle competition, in collaboration with researchers from the ition on Kaggle The University of Edinburgh. The challenge aims to assess whether artificial intelligence/machine learning can be used to identify and classify disorders of heart rhythm from synthetic ECG images which have been created to incorporate common artefacts.

The top scoring teams will be invited to participate in a British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre webinar about the challenge and the best performing will be invited to present their results at the British Cardiovascular Society (BCS) meeting in June 2025. Participation in these activities will require code sharing.


Find out more information and how to enter [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bhf-data-science-centre-ecg-challenge). 
This competition is currently open and runs until Monday 16th of December 2024.

## Gandalf Game
 
Test your LLM prompt skills by tricking Gandalf into revealing the secret password for each level. Each level gets progressively harder, with Gandalf first just giving the password to anyone that asks and later more creative approaches are needed. 

Played before? There's new adventures! Try Reverse Gandalf, where you tell Gandalf how to defend against password seeking users.

You can check it out here: [Gandalf Wizard AI](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/intro){target="_blank"}

## AI vs Human: Who wrote it best?

Can you tell when something has been written by a machine? Can you write like a machine?

Check out [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/){target="_blank"}, a free online AI checker which estimates its confidence that the text you input is or isn't AI generated. Think you can fool it? Try writing a short paragraph in the style of ChatGPT, and see if you can get it to think what you've written was really written by an LLM. Or flip the script: give your favourite LLM prompts to see if it can produce text that passes as human.

Was this text written by AI? Test it out!
