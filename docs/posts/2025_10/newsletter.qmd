# October Analyst X Data Science Huddle
</div>

Recently, the Data Science Community for Health and Care was invited to present at an AnalystX Huddle. We introduced who we are and various projects from our collaborators, NHS England Data Science and Applied AI Team, NHS Business Service Authority Data Science Team and the Department of Health and Social Care Data Science Team. It was an excellent opportunity for us to showcase the amazing and varied work happening in the data science space across the health care system. We hope those who attended found it interesting, and we wanted to thank the AnalystX team for giving us the opportunity to present.

# Events

Lots of exciting things coming up! See the [full calendar here](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=861745){target="_blank"}, and a small selection below.

### [EVENT TITLE](event link){target="_blank"}
**DATE, TIME, LOCATION,**

A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF EVENT 

### [The Health Foundation: Driving better health through English devolution](https://www.health.org.uk/events/driving-better-health-through-english-devolution){target="_blank"}
**Wednesday 5th November, 10:00 - 16:00, Aspire Leeds, 2 Infirmary St, Leeds LS1 2JP**

Regional government holds a range of powers and responsibilities that have the potential to improve people’s health. These include action on employment, the environment, housing, transport, and the economy. The government’s devolution agenda presents a vital opportunity for both newly established and existing Strategic Authorities to consider how they can maximize these powers to improve the health of their populations and reduce health inequalities.

This free one-day conference will be led by the Health Foundation, with support from the Mayoral Regions Programme (run on behalf of 10 Mayoral Strategic Authorities by the West Midlands Combined Authority). It will bring together colleagues from Strategic Authorities and their partners from across England to explore how regional leadership can drive better health outcomes.

The event will provide an opportunity to discuss embedding health in all policies in Mayoral Regions, working in partnership to improve health, and delivering local growth for health. We will explore examples of good practice, highlight opportunities and challenges, and offer space to learn from peers.

### [ONS Local Workshop: Building interactive onboarding tutorials in Power BI](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ons-local-workshop-building-interactive-onboarding-tutorials-in-power-bi-tickets-1544414989809?aff=ebdsoporgprofile&_gl=1*1p4ji66*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTUyMzk3NDY2NC4xNzU5ODMxMDA1*_ga_TQVES5V6SH*czE3NTk4MzEwMDUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTk4MzEwMDUkajYwJGwwJGgw){target="_blank"}
**Thursday 6th November, 09:30 - 11:00, Online**

Birmingham City Council have developed and run the Birmingham City Observatory, a public, open data platform on a wide range of characteristics of the city. Danny O’Neill, its creator, is an expert on building Power BI dashboards.   
Want your Power BI reports to guide users, not just display data? In this hands-on session, we’ll explore how to create interactive onboarding tutorials right inside your reports using layers, bookmarks, and clever design tricks. Whether you're introducing new dashboards or making complex reports more user-friendly, you'll learn practical ways to build guided experiences that actually stick.

Perfect for Power BI developers, analysts, and anyone who wants their reports to speak for themselves.

This event is free and open to all; however, we anticipate it will be of most interest to anyone working with Power BI dashboards to analyse data.

### [Privacy is Power - Data Ethics and Society Reading Group](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/dataethics/1836720/r/nhsdsteams){target="_blank"}
**Tuesday 11th November, 12:00 - 13:00, Online**  
**Wednesday 26th November, 13:00 - 14:00, Online**

Join us at the Data Ethics & Society Reading Group to discuss Privacy is Power by Carissa Véliz. 

"Digital technology is stealing our personal data and with it our power to make free choices. To reclaim that power and democracy, we must protect our privacy. Short, terrifying, practical: Privacy is Power highlights the implications of our laid-back attitude to data and sets out how we can take back control."

We will be holding two sessions over two weeks. The sessions will each focus on a different section of the book- but if you can't make the one you want to come to, we can still guarantee a great conversation! Read more about our changes in our recent [Data in Government blog post](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2025/02/17/data-ethics-and-society-join-the-conversation-in-2025/){target="_blank"}. 

* Tue 11 Nov 2025 12 PM - 1 PM (focusing on the first half of the book; the dangers the data economy poses and why we should care)
* Wed 26 Nov 2025 1 PM - 2 PM (focusing on the second half of the book; what can we do about it, and whose responsibility is it?)

The event is free, but you need to sign up to reserve your spot. Signups for the first session will close on Monday 3rd November at 6pm. Signups for the second session close on Tuesday 18th November at 6pm. 

### [BridgeAI Adopters and Developers event](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/bridgeai-adopters-and-developers-event){target="_blank"}
**Thursday 13th November, 09:00 - 17:30, Wallacespace, London,**

As AI adoption continues to reshape industries, this event offers an in-person space to explore collaborative opportunities, learn from peers, and access expert support tailored to your sector.

Whether you’re building AI tools or implementing them in your business, this event is your gateway to deeper engagement, practical insights, and valuable partnerships.

Event spaces are limited. Apply today to be considered for attendance, curated networking, and the BridgeAI PitchFest. This event is free.

### [ONS Local Workshop: Using R to wrangle data from web to output](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ons-local-workshop-using-r-to-wrangle-data-from-web-to-output-tickets-1784742746599?aff=ebdsoporgprofile&_gl=1*1xzq5a2*_up*MQ..*_ga*NzY2MjI0MDc3LjE3NjE4MTE4MDQ.*_ga_TQVES5V6SH*czE3NjE4MTE4MDMkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjE4MTE4MDMkajYwJGwwJGgw){target="_blank"}
**Thursday 27th November, 09:15 - 10:30, Online**

Dr. Dan Olner is a Y-PERN policy fellow and spatial economic data nerd based in the School of Management at Sheffield University. 

In this session, we'll work through some examples of using R to extract data directly from web sources (like NOMIS and online Excel sheets) and create pipelines through to final outputs. Automating as many of the steps as possible can be a huge help for quickly replicating and sharing analysis, and updating quickly when new data is published (though we'll also discuss how to deal with inevitable format changes). Common ONS economic datasets will be used. Some familiarity with R will be useful, though you should be able to run all code without. If you want a quick R primer prior to the session, see Dan's previous 'R for economic data' taster session (linked on the event webpage). 

This free workshop is open to everyone, but will be particularly suited to data analysts who are responsible for creating, maintaining and developing dashboards and other data outputs for local authorities.
