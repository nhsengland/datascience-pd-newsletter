# Interview with a Data Scientist - ADDDDDD
</div>
ADDDDD

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>

  ### How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?
  ADDDD

  ### Once you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?
  ADDDD

  ### What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you're particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?
  ADDDD

  ### If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?

# November Analyst X Data Science Huddle
</div>

Last week we had our November Analyst X Data Science Huddle! 

Ross Taylor presented his work on using geospatial analysis to optimise diagnostic capacity across the NHS South West region. This project mapped site competition and how easily people across the Southwest can reach key diagnostics; CT, MRI and Endoscopy to ensure new capacity goes where it helps most. This supports the rollout of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDC) by showing who benefits from the Phase 1 CDC placements and identifying future sites for Phases 2 and 3.

# December Analyst X Data Science Huddle
</div>
**Tuesday 16th December 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online**

The Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for December! The session will cover:  

* Unlocking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science Region - presented by Oracle

Join Oracle Data Science Leaders, for an in-depth exploration of how the NHS AnalystX community can leverage Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science - a robust collaborative platform designed to accelerate analytics and machine learning capabilities for healthcare organisations. OCI Data Science empowers teams to unlock insights in data safely, securely, and efficiently.

This event has been added to [our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=1253649){target="_blank"}, where you will find the calendar invite to access the event and further information. 

If you would like to be invited to future events of ours, [sign up to our mailing list!](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=slTDN7CF9UeyIge0jXdO48pr_29hyJFKpCZ7SYYvjeFUNUVPMUk0STlDRlJMNklIWEI3V0NZVTZXVS4u&route=shorturl){target="_blank"}

Lots of exciting things coming up! See the [full calendar here](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=861745){target="_blank"}, and a small selection below.

### [Health Data Science Seminar Series: Using data to tackle NHS pressures](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/health-data-science-seminar-series-using-data-to-tackle-nhs-pressures-tickets-1908979261359?aff=ebdsoporgprofile&_gl=1*1v2ve1i*_up*MQ..*_ga*ODE4MDM2NzA2LjE3NjQxNzIwMzY.*_ga_TQVES5V6SH*czE3NjQxNzIwMzUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjQxNzIwMzUkajYwJGwwJGgw){target="_blank"}
**Thursday 27th November, 14:00 - 15:30, Online**

Join us to learn how by harnessing data, the NHS can target interventions, reduce waste, and deliver sustainable, patient-centered care.  
Harnessing data effectively can help improve decision-making, efficiency, and patient outcomes. By turning information into insight, the NHS can target interventions, reduce waste, and deliver more sustainable, patient-centred care.

This series of seminars presents an exciting opportunity to hear about recent developments in health data science, generate ideas and help build the health data science community. It is hosted by the ONS in partnership with Health Data Research UK (HDR UK).

### [AI+ Research Seminars, October – December 2025](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/ai-research-seminars-october-december-2025){target="_blank"}
**Wedsnesday 3rd December, 14:00 - 15:00, Online,**

Hear directly from leading experts at King's College London about advancing AI research across diverse fields, from race and technology to computational biology to public health data. These monthly seminars showcase innovative approaches spanning disciplinary boundaries. 

Explore diverse AI research at King’s College London with our expert speakers. On 3rd December, Dr Georgia Richards on harnessing open data to track preventable deaths.

All seminars are online, free to attend, and open to everyone interested in hearing more from the experts about how they are doing research in, for, and with AI at King's. 

### [Machine Learning for tuning and control in Particle Accelerators](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/machine-learning-tuning-and-control-particle-accelerators-0){target="_blank"}
**Tuesday 9th December, 15:00 - 17:00, Online**

Machine learning (ML) is a key technology for advancing particle accelerators and should play a central role in their future design. ML methods provide fast predictions at lower computational cost than analytical or classical numerical approaches, capture nonlinear correlations in data, and adapt to changes in machine conditions. These capabilities enable robust online detection, prediction, optimisation, and control, while also supporting accelerator design by reducing the cost of numerical simulations and guiding parameter searches in high-dimensional spaces. Among ML applications, optimisation is particularly prominent, with Bayesian optimisation and reinforcement learning emerging as leading paradigms. 

In this seminar, Dr Andrea Santamaria Garcia will focus on tuning and control tasks in particle accelerators using these methods and demonstrate their performance in real machines.

### [AI, Engineering Biology and Beyond 2026](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/ai-engineering-biology-and-beyond-2026){target="_blank"}
**Thursday 15th January - Friday 16th January, 09:00 - 17:00, University of Bristol**

We're living through a revolution with AI and Engineering Biology colliding to unlock capabilities that seemed impossible just years ago. From designing new to nature proteins with AI, to reprogramming living cells and accelerating scientific discovery at breath-taking speed. This isn't incremental progress. This is a transformation. Join us in Bristol where pioneers, researchers, and innovators at the intersection of these fields will share their latest breakthroughs, challenge boundaries, and discuss what comes next.

The AI, Engineering Biology and Beyond 2026 event will take place at the University of Bristol, UK and consists of a 2-day conference (15-16 Jan 2026) and an optional 1-day hack-a-thon (14 Jan 2026). Full details about the speaker line up and schedule can be found at the conference website: https://aiebab.github.io/ .

We welcome submission of abstracts for consideration as short oral and poster presentations (before 19th December). These can be provided during the sign-up process. We are particularly interested in submissions from early career researchers (PhDs and postdocs) and will have number of travel awards to support their attendance that will be awarded once the schedule has been finalised.

Lunch, snacks and drinks will be provided throughout the 2 days of the main conference.
