# Civil Service Data Challenge Success!

I was a part of one of the teams who were finalists at the [civil service data challenge](https://datachallenge.uk/) (CSDC) which is an annual event where teams come together to pitch innovative ideas to secure funding. Think of it like Dragon's Den or Shark Tank but with friendlier judges who are all senior data leaders from across the public sector.  A multidisciplinary team chosen from the applicants across public sector were tasked to build a product roadmap for RouteCare, an NHS geospatial tool, that can be pitched for funding. We were among the four finalists, and we came a close second place (still gutted!). While it meant we didn't receive the funding, it was a huge achievement for the team! We were also the only all-women-panel which inspired several members of the audience who kindly congratulated us for our presentation - a highlight for me.
 
Now for some behind the scenes. This was not a hackathon but an entire "side" project involving multiple stakeholders. Once we were selected after the semi-finals, each team was allocated a mentor from the judging panel and ours was John Quinn, Chief Information Officer, NHS England. This helped in securing senior management buy-in straightaway, however expanded the vision of the product. John’s involvement opened several doors for us including obtaining buy-in from Helen Balsdon, Chief Nursing Information Officer, NHS England and partnership with Google to further build this tool.
 
We however lost a few team members to churn, and I took on the leadership of the tool. This was an excellent opportunity to pick up skills including different styles of leadership (technical and motivational), influencing senior stakeholders, collaboration with team members with diverse backgrounds, commercial negotiation and most of all, public speaking (presenting to a 200-member audience whilst being filmed isn't my idea of fun). 

I would highly recommend applying for the next cohort of CSDC if you would like an overall development opportunity which is unique and will certainly be a valuable experience for your career!
