# Microsoft Hack
</div>

![](amaia_hack_image.png)

The NHS England Data Science team, as well as a range of other analysts from across the organisation, attended an AI Hackathon at Microsoft, organised by the Data Science Team together with Microsoft and Kainos, with the key stakeholders being the NHS Websites Services Team. In this article, the author shares her experiences at the event.

Last week, the long awaited Hack for Health hosted at the beautiful Story Club, in Paddington London, by Microsoft and NHSE finally happened! At the hackathon, every team had either a Kainos or Microsoft representative, as well as a range of participants from across NHS England, including a strong Data Science Team presence, with several of our team members in each group. And unlike a usual hackathon, this one had stakeholders and well defined use cases, we were all working to one common goal.

## BBC Bitesize: AI or real? Christmas edition!

Artificial intelligence is already very impressive, with many AI images and videos so flawless that it can be difficult to tell what’s fake and what’s real. But as it continues to develop, will this become an impossible task?

Challenge yourself with this Christmas edition of [AI or real](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zv74tcw){target="_blank"}!

## Christmas Crossword

Love crosswords? Love Machine Learning and AI? Last year Ivan Reznikov published a [Christmas Data Science Crossword Puzzle](https://medium.com/@ivanreznikov/data-science-christmas-crossword-puzzle-327dec18cfab){target="_blank"}. 

Your family will love solving this together after Christmas dinner and definitely not throw wrapping paper at your head!

# Resources
</div>

For some, the festive period can allow a little bit of a reprieve from projects and meetings: the perfect time to do that training you always wanted to do but never had the time for. Consider blocking out some time for yourself to hit your learning goals!

## [Intro to Coding](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=56293968){target="_blank"}

The team have been busy updating the resources page of the FutureNHS site (free account required to access), including a new section full of resources on how to get started with Python. 

There are so many great resources to get you started on a data science journey.


## [Intro to LLMs](https://github.com/nhsengland/llm_tutorial){target="_blank"}

Sam and Adam Hollings have a public repository which will walk you through some simple LLM implementations. It uses free software and can all be run inside Google Collab, for maximum accessibility. It could not be easier to start learning about this essential area of data science!
