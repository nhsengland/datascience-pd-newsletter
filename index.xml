<p>The Professional Development Function Team are investigating the interest in starting up a Mentorship Scheme between senior and junior NHS Data Science colleagues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/professional-development/mentoring/benefits-of-a-mentoring-relationship.page" target="_blank">Mentorship benefits both parties</a>: mentees are provided with guidance from someone who has once been in their shoes and mentors gain insights from a new perspective, and gain experience in staff management and development.

<p>On Thursday 11th April we had our first Data Science discussion, hosted by Will Poulett. Data Science Discussions are a new event, focussed on peer to peer discussions on a broad range of Data Science topics. For this discussion Will asked everyone attending to research a future application of AI that interested them, and also consider how it could be later applied to healthcare. The discussion began with Will presenting his case: <a href="https://www.projectceti.org/" target="_blank">Project CETI</a>, who are applying advanced machine learning and state-of-the-art robotics to listen to and translate the communication of sperm whales. Check out his slide deck <a href="https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/msteams_2768a1/Shared%20Documents/FT%20-%20Professional%20Development/PD%20Events/Data%20Science%20Discussions?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=Tbm3Gq" target="_blank">here</a>. We then broke up into smaller groups to further discuss his case and our own.</p>
<p>The Professional Development Functional Team hope to hold Data Science Discussions monthly. If you have an area of Data Science you‚Äôre interested in sharing, and encouraging others to look into too, please <a href="mailto:datascience@nhs.net">contact us</a> to host a session! Most of the session is held in break out rooms, and so all you need to do is spark discussion.</p>

<p>NHS England has <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/leaders/" target="_blank">published the leadership competency framework</a> which comprises a set of leadership competencies incorporating the skills, values and behaviours required in NHS board roles and establishes what good looks like in leadership terms, providing a new and consistent national standard of leadership. Many of us are very far from those positions, but it does not hurt to aim high. But also, it is good to know what is expected of our leaders. These are the six leadership competency domains that you can learn about reading the framework:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Driving high-quality and sustainable outcomes</li>
<li>Setting strategy and delivering long-term transformation</li>
<li>Promoting equality and inclusion, and reducing health and workforce inequalities</li>
<li>Providing robust governance and assurance</li>
<li>Creating a compassionate, just and positive culture</li>
<li>Building a trusted relationship with partners and communities</li>

<p>Generative AI is increasingly used to draft, edit, annotate and debug code. It‚Äôs not just industry software developers who are taking advantage of the tools it has to offer. Those who develop and use software for academic research are benefitting from them too. So how do you make the best use of generative AI for coding in a research context? As software engineers with The Alan Turing Institute‚Äôs <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering-group" target="_blank">Research Engineering Group</a> (REG) and <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment" target="_blank">PhD Enrichment scheme</a>, we‚Äôve been asking ourselves just this question. <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/using-generative-ai-write-code-guide-researchers" target="_blank">Here</a>, we share our thoughts, along with some tips for researchers.</p>

<p>GitHub and GitLab are two very similar yet different platforms and that can lead to some confusion between teams who are familiar with one but not the other when some key pieces of terminology have been changed slightly between them. The RAP Community of Pracice have recently released a quick summary of some of these terminology differences. Read over this and you‚Äôll never get your MRs and PRs mixed up again!</p>

<p>As we adjust to delivering in the new team structure; using potentially unfamiliar tools like Confluence, JIRA and DevOps, getting to grips with new projects and new stakeholders, it‚Äôs the perfect time to refresh our understanding of what makes good delivery.</p>
<p>Delivery is the translation of the insights we produce into actionable outcomes. Keeping a delivery-focussed mindset is key to achieve value for money and improve lives for service users. Without it, we cannot fulfil our mission to drive the digital transformation of the NHS!</p>
<p>Delivery comes in different shapes and sizes, whether it‚Äôs being accountable for your own tickets or ensuring your team is focused on the top priorities ‚Äì each of us play our part.</p>
<p>Check out these top tips from our <a href="https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/DAT/Data+Science+Competency+Framework" target="_blank">Competency Framework</a>‚ùó :</p>
<ul>
<li>Break down complex objectives into clear tasks to deliver incremental value with each iteration</li>
<li>Regularly sync-up with stakeholders to understand priorities and manage delivery expectations</li>
<li>Be a role model to others by demonstrating a focus on delivery, whilst being open to new ideas and continuous improvement</li>
