<h1>Analyst X DS Huddle: Dual Project Showcase</h1>
</section>
<p><strong>23rd of September 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online</strong></p>
<p>The Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for September! The session will include two talks: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow, and Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare.</p>
<p><u>Abstract: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow</u></p>
<p>Poor admitted non-elective patient flow is a major issue for many acute trusts. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a useful tool for modelling patient pathways. This project used DES to model patient flow for non-elective admissions. The model was used to investigate how reductions in inpatient length of stay, non-criteria to reside, additional escalation beds and fluctuations in demand impact waits for admission in ED. The model allows testing of ad hoc scenarios, via a user-friendly streamlit app, and has also been used to provide evidence-based targets for inpatient length of stay and informed discussions about relevant flow metrics. In this talk I’ll discuss the model, how it works and some of the insights from the project and happy to answer any questions or receive any suggestions you may have!</p>
<p><u>Abstract: Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare</u></p>
<p>The current methods used for data linkage or indexing in the healthcare industry follow deterministic algorithms that are not transparent to the end users and with often sub-optimal outcomes. Our work focuses on building and implementing a probabilistic algorithm that improves quality as well as explainability of the linkage. In this project we have used Splink, a UK Ministry of Justice probabilistic linkage Python package, to build a pipeline that links any health data set to the Personal Demographics Service (PDS), a dataset containing information about all patients registered to a GP in England, which acts as our linkage “spine”.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-did-you-end-up-in-data-science-at-the-nhs-what-did-you-do-before-and-what-really-sparked-your-interest-in-this-field">How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?</h3>
<p><strong>Using technology to drive positive change? There’s no place I’d rather be!</strong></p>
<p>Making a real-world impact with technology has always been a key motivation for me, so when I saw how data science could make a difference in healthcare at the NHS, I was all in!</p>
<p>I’ve just finished my first year of university and decided to spend my summer exploring possible career paths. I’m currently studying Artificial Intelligence at King’s College London. Yes, AI is officially a degree now; Crazy, right?</p>
<p>I’ve always loved mathematics and computer science, but I specifically chose to study AI because of its multidisciplinary nature and my passion for AI Ethics. I became intrigued by AI ethics and understanding technology’s impact on society after watching the documentary ‘Coded Bias,’ which explored algorithmic bias in facial recognition technology. As an aspiring black woman in tech, seeing the impact of bias on people who look like me opened my eyes to a worrying reality. This inspired me to create an academic research poster on the topic, which I had the wonderful opportunity to present at the House of Lords!</p>
<p>My journey into data science began the summer after my GCSEs, with a four-week internship at QBE Insurance. I discovered I really enjoyed working with big data, and the following year, I had the chance to work at Circana, a big data and analytics company. I also gained a behind-the-scenes look at how tech companies use data to make decisions during my time as a data science mentee at Deliveroo.</p>
<p>I also dipped into quantitative finance, gaining software engineering experience at G-Research and spending time at PDT Partners, a quantitative investment firm. While I found these experiences incredibly interesting, I realised I’m more drawn to data science with a social or public impact—not just numbers, but outcomes that improve people’s lives.</p>
<p>That’s where the NHS came in. I’ve always been passionate about using technology as a force for good, and data science in healthcare feels like exactly that. Whether it’s tackling health inequalities, improving patient outcomes, or making systems run more efficiently, its impact is real and visible.</p>
<p>Alongside this internship, I’ve been an undergraduate research fellow at King’s, focusing on the ethical implications of AI in insurance law. I was also selected as one of 200 students for a BAME mentorship programme, where I was mentored by a PhD researcher working on ethics in language models.</p>
<p>So, between the technical side, the public good aspect, and my passion for ethical, responsible tech, data science in the NHS just made sense. Long-term, I’d love to work in AI policy or as a data ethicist, helping shape how technology is used fairly and safely across society. I’m also hoping to do a placement year in industry during my third year of university.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-you-currently-working-on-are-there-any-projects-that-youre-particularly-excited-about-or-that-you-feel-are-making-a-real-difference-what-impact-are-you-having">What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?</h3>
<p>I’ve been interning with the Data Science and Applied AI team for the past eight weeks. During this time, I’ve had the opportunity to learn, lead, and contribute in ways that have truly shaped my understanding of data science and AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>One of my most insightful experiences was speaking with front-line workers. I went to Epsom Hospital to talk with GPs about AI tools like Ambient Voice Technology and ran a small focus group to explore how AI impacts their daily work.</p>
<p>My main project has been the Synthetic Clinical Notes Project, where we create synthetic patient data to train an AI model for automating discharge summaries. When I joined, the dataset primarily used White British names and ethnicities. As someone from an ethnic minority with a culturally distinctive name, I recognised the risk of bias this could create. To address this, I’ve spent the last few weeks diversifying the naming data, researching names from a wide range of ethnic groups based on NHS staff survey statistics. By helping create a more representative dataset, I’ve contributed to making the project more ethically robust and ensuring it serves the public interest. I also helped update the style instructions for the clinicians who write these notes.</p>
<p>Alongside my project work, I’ve been completing the Edward Jenner Leadership Programme, spoke on AI ethics at a GOSH training session, developed my Python skills through the Federated Data Platform pipeline, and contributed to discussions around data hazard labels. These experiences have all deepened my commitment to building responsible and impactful technology.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="if-you-could-give-someone-just-starting-out-in-data-science-a-few-pieces-of-advice-what-would-they-be-and-what-resources-have-you-found-particularly-helpful-along-the-way-that-you-can-share">If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?</h3>
<p>My biggest piece of advice to an incoming data science intern would be to be inquisitive! Don’t hesitate to ask questions or ask for clarification. Many terms, concepts or abbreviations will probably be new to you and you don’t want to be left confused or behind in meetings or on your day-to-day.</p>
<p>Whilst you are here to learn and gain experience; you can also offer fresh and valuable perspectives too! Don’t be afraid to contribute and share your knowledge, opinions and ideas.</p>
<p>Stay open minded, don’t limit yourself to one particular career path or area of the team. Most people’s career paths aren’t linear so be open to trying new things and developing new skillsets. So, say yes to opportunities!</p>
<p>“Yes” has become one of my favourite words and has definitely opened more doors for me than I could have ever imagined. That being said, it’s important to know when to say no, and what meetings or experiences aren’t beneficial to you. Say yes to opportunities but don’t overwhelm yourself - it’s all about finding balance!</p>
<p>Take initiative, stay busy, ask for things to do. Strive for excellence in all you do - you want people to remember you for what you’ve done and the fact that you’ve done it well. I’d advise you to set goals for yourself to give yourself direction and so that you know what you’re working towards and have clarity on what you want to achieve before the end of your internship!</p>

<p>We hope you found this interview with Mobolu Olowoyeye interesting. Her journey demonstrates how a passion for ethical technology and a drive to make a positive impact is building the foundations for a meaningful career, providing an example on how to combine technical skills with a commitment to public good.</p>

<p><strong>23rd of September 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online</strong></p>
<p>The Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for September! The session will include two talks: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow, and Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare.</p>
<p><u>Abstract: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow</u></p>
<p>Poor admitted non-elective patient flow is a major issue for many acute trusts. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a useful tool for modelling patient pathways. This project used DES to model patient flow for non-elective admissions. The model was used to investigate how reductions in inpatient length of stay, non-criteria to reside, additional escalation beds and fluctuations in demand impact waits for admission in ED. The model allows testing of ad hoc scenarios, via a user-friendly streamlit app, and has also been used to provide evidence-based targets for inpatient length of stay and informed discussions about relevant flow metrics. In this talk I’ll discuss the model, how it works and some of the insights from the project and happy to answer any questions or receive any suggestions you may have!</p>
<p><u>Abstract: Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare</u></p>
<p>The current methods used for data linkage or indexing in the healthcare industry follow deterministic algorithms that are not transparent to the end users and with often sub-optimal outcomes. Our work focuses on building and implementing a probabilistic algorithm that improves quality as well as explainability of the linkage.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-did-you-end-up-in-data-science-at-the-nhs-what-did-you-do-before-and-what-really-sparked-your-interest-in-this-field">How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?</h3>
<p>I wouldn’t say I had a grand plan to get into data science — but looking back, it probably isn’t a huge surprise. When I was asked what I wanted to be at age 11, I said “a maths teacher,” which felt a bit out of step with the dreams of astronauts and footballers around me. That early love for numbers truly set the stage for my academic and professional life.</p>
<p>Fast forward to being 16, and I stumbled upon the existence of an Astrophysics degree. From that moment, that became the goal. I’ve always loved to describe astrophysics as “just maths with pretty pictures,” and honestly, what’s not to love about that combination? In 2018, fresh out of school, I embarked on a Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology MPhys at Lancaster University. My Masters project involved a deep dive into a dataset of 40,000 galaxies, performing extensive classification and statistical analysis. However, my very first taste of what I now recognise as data science techniques came during an internship at The University of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy. There, I used Markov-Chain Monte Carlo modelling to understand the shapes and densities of debris and dust around exoplanets, which even led to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522.6150I/abstract" target="_blank">this published paper</a>.</p>
<p>Nearing the end of my university studies, a significant realisation dawned on me: despite my enthusiasm for my degree and for astrophysics as a whole, I just wanted to contribute to something that had a tangible impact in the “real world.” So, I dove into the job market, applying to almost every role that claimed to welcome physics graduates, though with limited success. It was during a moment of frustration that my mum suggested: “Amaia, you love understanding complicated topics through reading and making graphs, why don’t you look for jobs where you can do that?”</p>
<p>That simple question was a revelation. It completely shifted my perspective, and I began searching for data-focused roles. That’s how I discovered the NHS Digital graduate scheme. It felt like the perfect alignment – an opportunity to explore a data career within a broader technical scheme, which meant I wasn’t locked into a single path. Crucially, it offered the chance to make a real difference for real people, within an organisation I deeply believe in.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="once-you-joined-the-nhs-what-was-that-experience-like-what-different-roles-and-teams-have-you-been-a-part-of-and-how-have-they-shaped-your-career">Once you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?</h3>
<p>I’ve now been with the NHS for nearly three years, beginning my journey at NHS Digital before its merger with NHS England. Over half of this time has been dedicated to data science roles. My initial placement at NHS Digital was within an analytics team in the Secondary Care area, where I primarily worked with <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/patient-reported-outcome-measures-proms" target="_blank">Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)</a> data.</p>
<p>For my second placement, I decided to venture into something completely different, joining the Run &amp; Maintain team in the NHS App as a software developer. It quickly became clear that this wasn’t my forte; I wasn’t very good at it, nor did I truly enjoy it. After spending a year at the NHS, observing my fellow grad, Will, creating “cool plots” for the <a href="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/our_work/cvd_pathways/" target="_blank">CVD Pathways project</a>, I decided that the team that he was in might be a good match. For my final placement, I decided to join the Data Science Team myself. I’ve since successfully graduated from the grad scheme and am now a permanent member of the Data Science and Applied AI Team.</p>

Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?</h3>
<p>Currently, I’m deeply involved with the Data Linkage Hub, specifically focusing on the <a href="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/our_work/data-linkage-hub/linkage-projects/better-matching/" target="_blank">probabilistic data linkage pipeline</a>. This project utilises a probabilistic model designed to accurately identify records belonging to the same patient, using their demographic information. The reason this project excites me so much is its foundational importance to almost all data work within our organisation. We handle immense volumes of data, and without the ability to reliably link records to individual patients, combining datasets to understand patient pathways would be fundamentally impossible. Accurate data linkage underpins the precision of our publications, the robustness of research studies, and ultimately, the efficacy of direct patient care. This is why I’ve been dedicated to this project since joining the team, and why I continue to be enthusiastic about its impact.</p>
<p>I also lead our Marketing &amp; Comms function team, where we focus on making sure people know about the work we’re doing, the impact it’s having, and the wide range of skills across the team. It’s a part of the role I really enjoy: I get to shout about work I genuinely believe in. You can get a flavour of it from the data science website I help run <a href="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<section id="if-you-could-give-someone-just-starting-out-in-data-science-a-few-pieces-of-advice-what-would-they-be-and-what-resources-have-you-found-particularly-helpful-along-the-way-that-you-can-share" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="if-you-could-give-someone-just-starting-out-in-data-science-a-few-pieces-of-advice-what-would-they-be-and-what-resources-have-you-found-particularly-helpful-along-the-way-that-you-can-share">If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?</h3>
<p>I believe that, more so now than even a couple of years ago when I started, there’s a strong temptation for people to apply AI and machine learning to every single problem. And as ironic as it might sound coming from someone whose job revolves around developing these products, one of the most invaluable skills I’ve got is the ability to critically assess a situation and determine when data science techniques are, in fact, not the optimal solution. Being able to think critically about the ethical implications and the practical usefulness – or lack thereof – of these products, in my opinion, makes me a more valuable team member and a more effective data scientist. Therefore, I would always advise anyone starting out to not just read about the benefits of certain techniques, but to dedicate significant time to understanding their pitfalls and limitations first.</p>
<p>My second piece of advice is that genuine enthusiasm and enjoyment in your work are the most powerful ways to succeed. Don’t pursue data science simply because it’s a popular or trendy field with growing job opportunities. Instead, figure out what truly brings you joy, be it coding, maths, creating visualisations, or anything else, and then explore how that passion aligns with the role of a data scientist. By doing so, you’ll naturally gravitate towards a niche within the vast landscape of data science, which in turn will make you a more attractive and unique candidate in the job market.</p>

</section>
<p><strong>22nd of July 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online</strong></p>
<p>The Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for July! The talk will cover building the NHSRwaitinglist package. Have a read of the abstract below:</p>
<p>Building R packages, or Python libraries, is a great way to share and disseminate your code. The process forces you to think about ‘productionising’ your code, the reproducibility of element, efficiency and the documentation of your code. Interaction with users of a package helps to identify issues, and open coding can encourage communities to fix these issues. This talk will share some of the principles of package building in R, including building functions, documenting functions, unit testing, use of GitHub and releasing a package to CRAN, the most well-known package repository. We will discuss the principles used in building the NHSRwaiting list package, a package to apply calculations and principles from queuing theory to NHS waiting list analysis. This package allows the calculation of target waiting times, understanding queue load, relief capacity required to meet target waiting times, and simple simulation of queues.</p>

<p><img src="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience-pd-newsletter/posts/2025_05/adam_hollings_career_journey.jpg" class="img-fluid"> Figure 1. What I imagined my career journey to be like and what it actually ended up being like</p>
<p>My career journey has been quite a winding path, much like a plate of spaghetti, with significant detours between the UK and China. Along the way, I’ve held various roles, including a call centre agent, claims handler, NHS Analyst, University Teacher, school owner, house husband, NHS Higher Analyst, and now, an NHS Data Scientist.</p>
<p>It’s been a rather circuitous route, but I’ll do my best to capture the key details! I always enjoyed science at school and had a keen interest in anime, which led me to pursue Biology and Japanese at the University of Sheffield. After graduating, I spent a brief period working as an analyst in the NHS – a path my twin brother encouraged me to explore. However, most of my time was spent teaching in various educational institutions in rural China, with a year dedicated to learning Chinese in a cement factory and another as a house husband.</p>
<p>Living in China was an incredibly enriching experience. I gained invaluable skills in public speaking and learned how to explain complex concepts in English to non-experts and non-native speakers. Immersing myself in a completely different language and culture, and experiencing life as a minority in a vast country, taught me a great deal about resilience, adaptability, and cultural understanding – both the highs and the lows. I also developed a strong tolerance for very spicy food and hot weather!</p>
<p>After about seven years in China, I was ready for a new challenge. I’d been observing my brother’s career at NHS Digital and found myself increasingly drawn to the work he was doing. This prompted me to spend about a year self-learning programming, which ultimately led to me securing a job at NHS Digital in 2020.</p>
<p>I thrive on challenges and naturally approach problems with a data-driven, analytical mindset. While my brother’s introduction initially opened the door to the NHS, once I saw the potential and understood the impact I could have, I knew it was the right place for me.</p>

What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?</h3>
<p>I’ve now worked in the NHS for over five years. My initial roles were as a contingent labour data analyst within the publications teams, primarily focusing on maternity and IAPT (Talking Therapies) data. I then successfully secured a permanent position and subsequently applied for and completed the Data Science MRes programme through NHS Digital at Leeds University.</p>
<p>It was the MRes programme itself that truly ignited my passion for data science. The rapid pace of developments in machine learning, the critical questioning of established methods and techniques, and the constant exploration of how cutting-edge innovations could directly benefit patients – it was exhilarating. I knew I wanted to be at the forefront of this field.</p>
<p>Following the MRes, I took on a role as a Data Wrangler in the NHS England Secure Data Environment (SDE) Service Team. I spent several fulfilling years there, working alongside a fantastic team, enabling numerous analysts and researchers to conduct vital research on vast amounts of de-identified NHS data. This position provided me with invaluable experience collaborating with high-profile stakeholders like the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Health Data Research UK (HDR UK). My previous teaching experience proved incredibly beneficial when it came to inducting and advising new users of the SDE. My time with the SDE service team also allowed me to build connections with members of the Central Data Science Team, which ultimately encouraged me to seek future opportunities within NHS England.</p>
<p>Eventually, I wanted to transition from enabling others’ data science work to having a more direct, hands-on role myself. So, this year, I embarked on an exciting new chapter within the Central Data Science Team.</p>

Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?</h3>
<p>I’ve recently joined the A&amp;E Forecasting project, which was recently nominated as an AI Exemplar. The ability to accurately forecast A&amp;E attendances and admissions has the potential to significantly aid planning across almost every hospital in the country. Knowing that I’ll be contributing to maintaining and improving this crucial model is incredibly exciting. My current focus is on enhancing how weather data is incorporated into the model. It’s been fascinating to delve deeper into using the Unified Data Access Layer (UDAL) and learning the intricacies of the Federated Data Platform (FDP), as most of my recent years were spent working with the Data Access Environment (DAE) and the SDE. After learning Chinese and Japanese, I’m certainly not afraid of being thrown into new situations and having to acquire new skills!</p>
<p>Beyond this, I also have a keen interest in open-source large language models (LLMs) and have recently been appointed as the team’s technical lead in this area. Additionally, I’m deeply invested in causal inference methodology, understanding the potentially disastrous consequences of improperly applied causal analysis.</p>
<p>I’m also committed to ensuring our projects achieve the greatest possible impact by actively supporting the Marketing and Communications function team. Given the current organisational landscape, I believe it’s especially critical to ensure that our work and its significant benefits are well-understood across both NHS England and the DHSC. Recent Marketing and Comms initiatives I’ve contributed to include setting up the Data Science Team’s SharePoint page, gathering and submitting entries for the Advanced Analytics Analytical Prospectus, and currently working on the Data Science Brochure.</p>

And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?</h3>
<p>While I consider myself a dedicated team player, I would advise new members to be proactive, honest, and strategically self-aware. By “strategically self-aware,” I mean that when you’re asked about project preferences or which function team you’d like to join, choose what genuinely aligns with and benefits your career trajectory. Be transparent with your manager about any challenges or if a long-term project isn’t personally contributing to your growth. Project allocations are based on both business need and individual preference; leadership can’t account for your preferences if you’re not open about them.</p>
<p>When I say “be proactive,” I mean actively participate: ask questions in meetings, confidently present your work, and ensure people are aware of who you are, the impactful things you’re working on, and your accomplishments. This could involve consistently marketing your work! It’s perfectly fine to let your personality shine through – I always look forward to Warren’s weekly meme post, and if even one person in the team gets a laugh from my regular Teams background rotations, it’s worthwhile. These small personal touches help endear people to you, make you memorable, and significantly build team spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday 3rd June, 14:30 - 16:00, Online</strong></p>
<p>New research from the UK shows that almost a quarter of children aged 8 – 12 already use generative AI, but these tools have not been designed with children’s needs in mind. This leads to children being exposed to inappropriate or harmful content and risks potential negative impacts on children’s wellbeing.</p>
<p>Yet the research also demonstrates that children are excited about the ways generative AI could be used to support them in their learning and for play, if developed and deployed responsibly.</p>
<p>Over the course of the “Understanding the impacts of generative AI use on children” project, The Alan Turing Institute’s Children and AI team and AI for Public Services team have explored the perspectives of children, parents, carers and teachers on generative AI technologies. Their research was guided by the framework for children’s online well-being established by the UNICEF project ‘Responsible Innovation in Technology for Children’.</p>
<p>This webinar will share the key findings of the project’s two work packages namely, surveys with children, parents, carers and teachers, and school-based engagements undertaken in collaboration with Children’s Parliament. Researchers will share insights into the observed impacts of generative AI on children’s wellbeing and additional insights from teachers about how generative AI is being used within classrooms.</p>

<h1>Exploring associations in survey data with machine learning and tidymodels: AnalystX DS Huddle</h1>
</section>
<p><strong>17th of June 2025, 13:30 - 14:30, Online</strong></p>
<p>The Data Science Community for Health and Care has organised a talk on exploring associations in survey data with machine learning and tidymodels. Have a read of the abstract below:</p>
<p>Supervised machine learning can be used to understand the factors associated with a result or outcome. In this huddle we will compare using two different machine learning algorithms to explore the results of the General Practice Patient Survey, a national publicly-available dataset. What can supervised learning tell us about factors that are associated with overall patient satisfaction? And how can using different algorithms for the same machine learning task strengthen the quality and robustness of our findings? R and the tidymodels collection of packages will be used to show how different models can be applied to the same dataset with minimum fuss, though the approach will also be of interest to users of Python and other programming languages. This work continues to evolve, and constructive feedback is very welcome!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-did-you-end-up-in-data-science-at-the-nhs-what-did-you-do-before-and-what-really-sparked-your-interest-in-this-field">How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?</h2>
<p>I studied chemistry at the University of Leeds; after my undergraduate degree, I stayed on to pursue a PhD in organic chemistry.</p>
<p>My research focused on peptides and proteins, which meant a significant amount of time in the lab, and more time than I’d like to recall spent washing glassware! However, a turning point came when the department acquired a robot to run experiments. This was my first real immersion in programming and data handling.</p>
<p>Towards the end of my PhD, I came across a job advertisement for the Government Operational Research Service (GORS), a service often considered a precursor to modern data science. I applied and was placed within the Department of Health.</p>
<p>I’ve remained within the health sector and the realm of data ever since, for about 17 years now, although I’ve had the opportunity to work in many different areas.</p>
<p>My passion for data science truly ignited around 2016, and I took the initiative to establish a small data science team within the Department of Health. Since then, I’ve held a variety of roles across the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), NHS England, and NHSX. I also spent some valuable time at Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust and in a data policy role. Ultimately, though, leading a data science team is where my true passion lies.</p>

<section id="what-are-you-currently-working-on-are-there-any-projects-that-youre-particularly-excited-about-or-that-you-feel-are-making-a-real-difference-what-impact-are-you-having" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-you-currently-working-on-are-there-any-projects-that-youre-particularly-excited-about-or-that-you-feel-are-making-a-real-difference-what-impact-are-you-having">What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?</h2>
<p>As Deputy Director of the Data Science team at NHS England, my focus has shifted from direct project involvement to leading the team and shaping its strategic direction. While I miss the day-to-day project work, I now dedicate my time to raising the team’s profile and securing new opportunities for us to contribute.</p>
<p>Two current areas of work particularly excite me. Firstly, the ongoing development of data science as a recognised profession within the NHS.</p>
<p>For example, our PhD intern programme, which connects the NHS with early-career researchers in academia, has been running successfully for several years (more information can be found <a href="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/PhDInterns/">here</a>). This initiative brings fresh perspectives and skills into the NHS.</p>
<p>We also now oversee a Data Science Masters programme, a fantastic opportunity to provide advanced training to our colleagues, enhancing their capabilities and the overall data science capacity within the NHS.</p>
<p>I was also involved in developing the data science <a href="https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=31311216">competency frameworks</a> and, more recently, a continuous professional development policy. I firmly believe that having a clear, fair, well-defined, and well-promoted profession is crucial for attracting and retaining talent and ensuring high standards.</p>
<p>More recently, I’ve had the rewarding experience of engaging in school outreach. The sessions at primary schools were particularly memorable; the children’s questions are often wonderfully wild, funny, and insightful!</p>
<p>The second area that truly excites me is shaping the new projects coming into the team. I’m particularly keen to see how data science can effectively support the digital transformation initiatives within the NHS, as well as inform crucial operational decisions.</p>
<p>It’s fascinating to observe how different teams operate and identify how data science can provide valuable assistance. I play a key role in scoping these projects to ensure they not only meet but potentially exceed the initial requirements.</p>
<p>Increasingly, we’re seeing colleagues interested in leveraging the power of AI in their work, which brings exciting new challenges, opportunities, and collaborations for our team.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="if-you-could-give-someone-just-starting-out-in-data-science-a-few-pieces-of-advice-what-would-they-be-and-what-resources-have-you-found-particularly-helpful-along-the-way-that-you-can-share">If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?</h2>
<p>My advice for aspiring data scientists would be two things:</p>
<p>Firstly, cultivate the ability to explain complex, technical, and potentially dry subjects in a simple and engaging manner. Think to yourself, ‘Can I explain what I’m doing to a 9-year-old in a way that they would not only understand but also find captivating?’ Channel your inner kids’ TV presenter or science journalist!</p>
<p>A great way to achieve this is by using everyday analogies. Try comparing a project, process, or problem to a familiar, everyday situation. Recently, when explaining technical concepts, I’ve used examples like visiting a restaurant or using an iPhone.</p>
<p>If you can help people, feel intelligent (rather than prioritising making yourself appear intelligent!), they are far more likely to engage with and remember what you’re trying to convey.</p>
<p>It’s natural, after completing a complex piece of work, to want to highlight its difficulty and intricacy. While sometimes this is necessary, generally, strive to find common ground and make the concepts accessible.</p>
<p>Secondly, ensure you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of the data science technique or approach you’re using, including its potential weaknesses as well as its strengths compared to other methods.</p>
<p>In an age where we can execute complicated processes and code with a few clicks, it’s not always mandatory to delve into the underlying statistical models. However, to build your own confidence and effectively explain your work to others, this understanding of the fundamentals is, for me, paramount. It also equips you to critically evaluate the next ‘new big thing’ that emerges. Aim to be a cynical optimist in your approach.</p>

<p>We’re told AI is taking an increasingly important role in decision-making, but what does this really mean? And how should we, the people, respond to this? Understanding how AI is <em>really</em> being used for prediction and decision-making is the best tool for interpreting the daily flow of AI news.</p>
<p>Three researchers from the Alan Turing Institute will take to the stage to help. We’ll hear how AI is being used in the real world and how it relates to the big things in life: health, travel safety and (most important of all) the weather. Plus join in with our annual Big Quiz of AI!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-did-you-end-up-in-data-science-at-the-nhs-what-did-you-do-before-and-what-really-sparked-your-interest-in-this-field">How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?</h2>
<p>My journey to data science at the NHS is a blend of engineering roots, a pandemic pivot, and a strong personal connection to healthcare.</p>
<p>My academic background began with an Integrated Master’s in Aerospace Engineering. I was captivated by the problem-solving inherent in understanding how complex systems, particularly aircraft, function. This fascination with engineering persists, as evidenced by my continued interest in aerospace content.</p>
<p>A pivotal moment that hinted at my future direction occurred during a second-year Business Simulation module. We were tasked with managing car companies within a simulated European market. I developed a comprehensive spreadsheet to optimise production, enabling us to create cost-effective cars with popular features. I would go on to make many more spreadsheets, including one that calculated my mark margins for upcoming exams to allow me to still graduate with first class honours.</p>
<p>Following graduation, I joined a small engineering firm, where I contributed to the development of control software for automated test rigs. We built custom rigs to test components like aircraft actuators and truck brake assemblies, using the visual programming language LabVIEW. This involved wiring code sections together, and I still recognise LabVIEW’s distinctive interface in various applications, including airport airbridge controls.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I lost my job around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, coinciding with a severe contraction of the job market. During the lockdown, I used the time to learn Python, which sparked a realisation that I wanted to pursue a career in data science. While I’d always enjoyed numbers, spreadsheets, problem-solving, and programming, the pandemic provided the catalyst to connect these interests.</p>
<p>I enrolled in a Data Science conversion Master’s program at Loughborough University, joining the inaugural cohort of the degree. The decision to apply to the NHS was deeply personal. My father was a GP and healthcare consultant, and my then-girlfriend (now wife), was training to be a doctor. The NHS’s mission resonated with me, and I discovered the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme. I applied and was fortunate enough to be accepted.</p>
<p>I began my role at the NHS just two weeks after submitting my Master’s project.</p>
</section>
<section id="once-you-joined-the-nhs-what-was-that-experience-like-what-different-roles-and-teams-have-you-been-a-part-of-and-how-have-they-shaped-your-career" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="once-you-joined-the-nhs-what-was-that-experience-like-what-different-roles-and-teams-have-you-been-a-part-of-and-how-have-they-shaped-your-career">Once you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?</h2>
<p>Joining the NHS was a real whirlwind, but in the best way possible! I’ve been here for three years now, starting at NHS Digital and then transitioning into NHS England after the merger. My first two years were spent on the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme, and since then, I’ve been working as a full-fledged Data Scientist.</p>
<p>That Graduate Scheme was incredible. We were the first cohort of its kind, a group of just under twenty, and we kicked things off with an intense eight-week coding bootcamp. It was a fantastic bonding experience – we’d be hammering away at code and then decompressing with board games during breaks.</p>
<p>My first placement on the NHS Spine project, which is this massive, intricate system connecting all sorts of different NHS systems. Because it’s so complex, everyone was constantly learning, and that made it a really supportive environment for a newbie like me. Plus, I got to see firsthand what a well-oiled DevOps team looked like, which really shaped my approach moving forward, especially when I landed in the Business Intelligence Development Team.</p>
<p>That team was all about building Tableau dashboards and trying to standardise things. My manager asked me to dig into the Tableau API. They had this super slow, manual process for checking dashboards, and I realised we could automate it with Python. So, I built a proof-of-concept testing framework, which was a great chance to put my NHS Spine lessons to work in a totally different area.</p>
<p>My final placement was with the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) Squad. We were all about promoting good coding practices for analytics and helping teams automate their workflows. Basically, we were bringing in the best of data and software engineering into the data science and analytics space. In that role, I got to write articles, create training guides, and even run workshops. We also did these ‘Engagements’ with other analytical teams, helping them improve their processes. After a year, I passed my end-of-scheme interview and got promoted to a Band 7 Data Scientist, staying with the RAP Squad and leading those Engagements.</p>
<p>More recently, I moved to the National Secure Data Environment Service Team, or the SDE Data Wranglers. We make sure researchers get the right, pseudonymised data. While there, I also got to work on a side project developing an ML-powered tool to detect potentially sensitive information in huge datasets. It was a fun challenge, working with Docker containers, PySpark, and figuring out how to deploy ML models in a clustered computing environment.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s been a really varied and rewarding experience. Each role has built on the last, and I’ve learned so much about the NHS and the power of data.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-you-currently-working-on-are-there-any-projects-that-youre-particularly-excited-about-or-that-you-feel-are-making-a-real-difference-what-impact-are-you-having">What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?</h2>
<p>Right now, I’m embedded within an analytical team focused on commissioning specialised NHS services. It’s a really interesting area, and I’m helping them boost their Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) compliance, automate some of their manual processes, and bring in some Python expertise to diversify their toolkit.</p>
<p>One project I’m particularly excited about is automating their monthly reporting. We’ve managed to cut the processing time from a week down to just a few minutes, which is a huge win! It’s incredibly rewarding to free up my colleagues’ time, allowing them to focus on more impactful, data-driven insights rather than repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>I’m also personally driven to achieve something new for me; building a pipeline that meets <a href="https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/">Gold RAP compliance</a> standard; essentially, a fully automated and packaged analytical process. We’re facing some interesting challenges, but I’m confident that overcoming them will pave the way for more efficient and robust projects in the future.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="if-you-could-give-someone-just-starting-out-in-data-science-a-few-pieces-of-advice-what-would-they-be-and-what-resources-have-you-found-particularly-helpful-along-the-way-that-you-can-share">If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?</h2>
<p>If I could give some advice to someone starting out in data science, I’d say:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider a conversion master’s if it’s feasible.</strong> Mine was a game-changer. It accelerated my learning so much, and it gave me a strong portfolio to show potential employers right away.
<ul>
<li><strong>Dive into online resources, but don’t get lost in them.</strong> There’s a wealth of information out there! <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python">Kaggle Learn</a> is a fantastic starting point.</li>
<li><strong>Master Git and GitHub.</strong> Seriously, this is crucial. I even helped create a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOk7wDsHD8o">workshop</a> for the NHS-R Community and some <a href="https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/introduction-to-git/">training materials</a> on it, which you can find on the <a href="https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/">RAP Community of Practice</a> website. Learning Git and GitHub will also allow you to use GitHub codespaces, and avoid the pain of setting up your local environment.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t just stick to tutorials.</strong> It’s easy to get stuck in tutorial hell. Find a simple, personal project that excites you. Mine was building a tool to optimise my Fantasy F1 team. Passion projects are a great way to build a portfolio and showcase your skills.</li>
</ul>
Basically, combine structured learning with practical application, and don’t be afraid to explore your own interests!</li>
</ul>

<h1>Probabilistic Data Linkage in NHS England Goes Open Source!</h1>
</section>
<p>The Data Linkage Hub has been developing a probabilistic data linkage pipeline to enhance the quality of data linkage in the NHS. We’re excited to share that the first iteration is now openly available on <a href="https://github.com/nhsengland/NHSE_probabilistic_linkage" target="_blank">Github</a>!</p>
<p>Each stage of the pipeline has been shaped by extensive research into best practices, rigorous testing on samples of the real data, feasibility assessments of computational demands, and thorough evaluation. Our approach is incremental, with planned iterative improvements to ensure the highest standards of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.</p>
<p>While this pipeline is not yet in use, it represents the foundation of what we plan to deploy within the Federated Data Platform (FDP). Our next step is to quality assure the pipeline, refining it further before implementation.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more, visit our <a href="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/our_work/data-linkage-hub/linkage-projects/better-matching/" target="_blank">website</a> or <a href="mailto:jonathan.laidler1@nhs.net" target="_blank">get in touch</a>!</p>

<p>It’s well known that LLM’s such as ChatGPT use a lot of energy, with estimates varying widely from 5 to 200+ times more energy than a Google search. With the popularity of LLM’s for everyday use growing, the total energy consumption is rising. Being aware of the energy consumption of your code is not only more important than ever, it is also easier than ever to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/" target="_blank">CodeCarbon</a> is a <a href="https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon" target="_blank">open-source</a> Python package designed to help you estimate the carbon footprint of computing tasks, particularly for machine learning and other high-performance computing workloads. It does this by estimating your hardware electricity power consumption (GPU + CPU + RAM) and applies the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done. More is explained about this calculation in the <a href="https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/methodology.html" target="_blank">Methodology section</a> of the documentation.</p>
<p>Add this (or any other tracker you know of!) to your next pipeline and start taking steps toward more sustainable computing.</p>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly being used across the NHS, but did you know you can use LLMs to evaluate other LLMs?</p>
<p>LLM-as-a-Judge is a versatile technique we have been researching in the NHS England Data Science Team. To find out exactly how this technique works, you can read our new article here: <a href="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/articles/2024/12/31/LLM-as-a-Judge/" target="_blank">What is LLM-as-a-Judge and how can we use it? - NHS England Data Science</a></p>

<h1>AI Opportunities Action Plan</h1>
</section>
<p>On the 13th January the Government published the AI Opportunities Action Plan, outlining how they want to have Britain shape the AI revolution. The plan outlines how Britain must invest in the foundations of AI, push hard on cross-economy AI adoption and position the UK to be an AI maker, not an AI taker.</p>
<p>The plan outlines 50 points that the government should take up in order to achieve its goals, and concludes that while the task is not small the benefits are likely to be transformational to both the economic growth of the country and the lives of those across the UK.</p>

<p><img src="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience-pd-newsletter/posts/2024_12/amaia_hack_image.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The NHS England Data Science team, as well as a range of other analysts from across the organisation, attended an AI Hackathon at Microsoft, organised by the Data Science Team together with Microsoft and Kainos, with the key stakeholders being the NHS Websites Services Team. In this article, the author shares her experiences at the event.</p>
<p>Last week, the long awaited Hack for Health hosted at the beautiful Story Club, in Paddington London, by Microsoft and NHSE finally happened! At the hackathon, every team had either a Kainos or Microsoft representative, as well as a range of participants from across NHS England, including a strong Data Science Team presence, with several of our team members in each group. And unlike a usual hackathon, this one had stakeholders and well defined use cases, we were all working to one common goal.</p>

<h1>RPySOC: Conference Musings</h1>
</section>
<p><em>written by Jennifer Struthers</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If you are a regular reader of this newsletter you might have seen the <a href="https://nhsrcommunity.com/conference24.html" target="_blank">RPySOC event</a> plugged each month, which was at long last held last week. The conference was a celebration of all things R/Python/Open-Source, and everyone there was excited to show off the projects they had been involved in over the last year.</p>
<p>There were at least 100 people gathered in the Birmingham International Conference Centre, and more present online where the talks were being live-streamed. People seemed to be saying hello to colleagues that they hadn’t seen in a while, and sitting down at tables to meet new people and discuss all things healthcare and coding.</p>
<p>I went along to present my <a href="https://github.com/nhsengland/opensource_maternity_dashboard_project" target="_blank">project on experimenting with open-source dashboarding tools and packages</a>, which I had undertaken earlier this year to develop my data visualisation and general coding skills. It was a brief talk, with just a 15 minute timeslot, but I got surprisingly more nervous as the morning went on. I’ve given variants of this presentation before, and I was confident in answering any questions on it, really I should have been fine. However this was the first time since I was in university that I had stood in front of people and spoken to them, instead of hidden behind my computer screen talking to my slides. Strange how something like hybrid working has completely changed something as fundamental as giving a presentation.</p>
<p>Luckily, my fears were unfounded. The stage lights were so bright I couldn’t see anyone anyway and I could pretend I was still at my desk, talking at my slides like normal. Before I knew it I was back at my table and could breathe and enjoy the rest of the conference, while typing away to answer all the questions and comments that had come through during my talk.</p>
<p>There was a Slack channel organised for questions which meant that online viewers had the same chance to ask questions as in-person attendees, and the speakers could take their time afterwards to answer extra questions and give links. Almost every single presentation included links to public GitHub repositories, and people were actively encouraged to check out the code, and re-use whatever they wanted to.</p>
<p>The whole conference was focused on sharing, collaborating and supporting others, regardless of where they were at in the coding journey. It was a great gathering of a community (full of provided food and coffee!), and what really struck me was how keen everyone was to get involved, give people pointers, and congratulate them on the work they had done. The talks were evenly distributed between Python and R users, and everything pitched at a level anyone with a coding interest could understand. If you’ve got a project you’re working on and are keen to share the results in front of an audience, I would definitely recommend next year’s RPySOC!</p>
<p>The conference organisers will be sharing the recordings of the talks, along with slides and links, at a later date so that the knowledge can be shared on and on.</p>

<h1>Data Science Discussion</h1>
</section>
<p><img src="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience-pd-newsletter/posts/2024_11/sci_comm.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The data science team at NHS England hold Data Science Discussions on a monthly (ish!) basis. These discussions are typically informal, and in a small group to encourage as much discussion as possible. The most recent Data Science Discussion was delivered by Ben Wallace, one of the senior data scientists within the team.</p>
<p>Ben was keen to introduce the idea of science communication and how to get your ideas across correctly. We discussed how to explain complex topics such as lossy compression in an easily understandable manor. Through examples we discussed when explanations were too complex, too simple, or just right, before having a go ourselves at explaining tricky data science terms.</p>

<h1>Data Science Discussion: Professional Development Edition</h1>
</section>
<p><img src="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience-pd-newsletter/posts/2024_10/dsd_header.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Last month we ran another Data Science Discussion, an event where we have a host prepare a topic for discussion and then we split into breakout rooms to allow more people to have their say. These discussions aren’t recorded, we want to make everyone feel as comfortable as possible to discuss their thoughts and ideas on whatever topic we are talking about.</p>
<p>Most recently our discussion focussed on professional development in our current roles, and how we can support others to take advantage of the opportunities they have.</p>
<p>One discussion point that came up in a few groups was the difference between purposeful development time versus just doing the job and where the line is drawn between them. It was felt that a lot of the work we do involves researching and learning about different techniques and methods, and that this could really also be considered professional development.</p>
<p>A theme that also came up across groups was the lack of time available for dedicated professional development for topics and areas that are separate from the day to day work. A lot of people felt like they had limited time for self-directed study, and that getting the job done took priority which led to professional development taking a back seat. In order to mitigate this, people suggested blocking out calendar time in advance in order to pre-book learning time, although sticking to this can be hard if you’re busy.</p>
<p>We had members from various NHS teams present at this discussion and there was also a definite split, with some teams feeling like they were allowed a lot more time and were encouraged to take development opportunities more than others. This highlighted a bit of a difference in team culture, and there was discussion about how those who are allotted more time could support those without.</p>
<p>The most engaging discussion point? Whether a hot dog is a sandwich. We’re still split on it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ai-vs-human-who-wrote-it-best">AI vs Human: Who wrote it best?</h2>
<p>Can you tell when something has been written by a machine? Can you write like a machine?</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://gptzero.me/" target="_blank">GPTZero</a>, a free online AI checker which estimates its confidence that the text you input is or isn’t AI generated. Think you can fool it? Try writing a short paragraph in the style of ChatGPT, and see if you can get it to think what you’ve written was really written by an LLM. Or flip the script: give your favourite LLM prompts to see if it can produce text that passes as human.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest Professional Development newsletter, brought to you by the Data Science skilled team Professional Development Functional Team.</p>
<p>The newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.</p>
<p>There are some legacy NHS Digital items which we have identified with❗</p>
<p>If you cannot access something of interest to you, please <a href="https://github.com/nhsengland/datascience-pd-newsletter/issues/new" target="_blank">reach out</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! – PD newsletter team</p>

<h1>Civil Service Data Challenge Success!</h1>
</section>
<p><em>Divya Balasubramanian (below, third from left) recently led her team to an amazing second place at the Civil Service Data Challenge. Read about the challenge and her experience below.</em></p>
<p float="center">
<img src="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience-pd-newsletter/posts/2024_09/Public sector team.jfif" alt="Public Sector Team" width="465"> <img src="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience-pd-newsletter/posts/2024_09/logo_chatgpt.jpg" alt="AI Generated Logo for " width="310">
</p>
<p>I was a part of one of the teams who were finalists at the <a href="https://datachallenge.uk/">civil service data challenge</a> (CSDC) which is an annual event where teams come together to pitch innovative ideas to secure funding. Think of it like Dragon’s Den or Shark Tank but with friendlier judges who are all senior data leaders from across the public sector. A multidisciplinary team chosen from the applicants across public sector were tasked to build a product roadmap for RouteCare, an NHS geospatial tool, that can be pitched for funding. We were among the four finalists, and we came a close second place (still gutted!). While it meant we didn’t receive the funding, it was a huge achievement for the team! We were also the only all-women-panel which inspired several members of the audience who kindly congratulated us for our presentation - a highlight for me.</p>
<p>Now for some behind the scenes. This was not a hackathon but an entire “side” project involving multiple stakeholders. Once we were selected after the semi-finals, each team was allocated a mentor from the judging panel and ours was John Quinn, Chief Information Officer, NHS England. This helped in securing senior management buy-in straightaway, however expanded the vision of the product. John’s involvement opened several doors for us including obtaining buy-in from Helen Balsdon, Chief Nursing Information Officer, NHS England and partnership with Google to further build this tool.</p>
<p>We however lost a few team members to churn, and I took on the leadership of the tool. This was an excellent opportunity to pick up skills including different styles of leadership (technical and motivational), influencing senior stakeholders, collaboration with team members with diverse backgrounds, commercial negotiation and most of all, public speaking (presenting to a 200-member audience whilst being filmed isn’t my idea of fun).</p>
<p>I would highly recommend applying for the next cohort of CSDC if you would like an overall development opportunity which is unique and will certainly be a valuable experience for your career!</p>

<p>Recently, we held another Data Science Discussion, where we encourage people to look into a different area or use case of data science than they might strictly look at in their day job and spark discussion on a peer-to-peer level.</p>
<p>This time we delved into the intriguing topic of data science and democracy, hosted by Mia Noonan.</p>
<p>Mia kicked off the discussion by asking the group to consider the different ways data science could interact with and potentially reshape the political landscape. One of the key ideas presented was the concept of AI-driven profiles that could be created based on an individual’s opinions and values, with the potential to vote on bills and acts on their behalf. This led to a lively debate on the implications of such a system, and what type of democracy we’d like to see AI help facilitate- representative, direct or deliberative.</p>
<p>Throughout the session, the group expressed a healthy dose of skepticism, particularly regarding the biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems. Concerns were raised about the potential for AI to reflect and even exacerbate existing biases, as well as the broader implications for democracy and personal agency. The discussion highlighted the complex and often controversial nature of combining AI with politics, but also the potential for innovative applications that could transform how we engage with governance.</p>
<p>The Professional Development Functional Team is excited to continue hosting these monthly Data Science Discussions. If you have a data science topic you’re passionate about and would like to share with others, please reach out to us to host a session. The format is designed to be collaborative and conversational, with most of the session taking place in breakout rooms, so all you need is a spark of inspiration to get the conversation started.</p>

<h1>Health and Care Analytics Conference</h1>
</section>
<p><em>This month some of the NHS England Data Science team went to the Health and Care Analytics Conference (HACA) 2024, hosted in Telford. The team had various talks, posters and workshops delivered at the conference about our work and projects. Warren Davies reports back.</em></p>

<figcaption>NHS England RAP Star Warren Davies giving a talk at HACA on RAP Principles</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>At the HACA conference 2024 I gave a talk on RAP to a huge crowd, over 4,000 people, great people, the best people. OK more like 70. And I also helped run workshops on Python and RAP. I highly recommend the experience overall. I gained the following XP:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>+10 Planning</strong> – it’s tricky to plan when you don’t know in advance the size and experience of the audience (in the workshops we opted to give a flavour of what was possible, along with some simple exercises people could follow along with).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>+10 Schmoozing</strong> – it is actually very easy. People are very happy to talk about their work and how you might be able to help them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>+20 Resilience</strong> – public speaking can be nerve wracking but that is OK, it’s just weakness leaving the body.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But you also have the opportunity to help other people. It’s easy to take for granted in NHS England that we basically have a huge bunch of geniuses at our beck and call that that we can pester and learn from every day. But not every analyst in the wider NHS and health world is so lucky. Within trusts and regional organisations, there are often small teams - or even individuals - who do similar work to us but don’t have the kind of support we do.</p>
<p>With events like HACA we have the chance to connect with them, and point them to resources and communities they might not know about. Which not only helps them, but gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside too (incidentally, it also ticks a whole load of those “Sharing knowledge” boxes on the competency framework…).</p>
<p>You should definitely go next time. You will build your networking skills, help people out, and get loads of great examples you can use when you apply for that promotion. Plus, everyone loves a road trip right?</p>
<section id="school-placement" class="level1 section-heading">
<h1>School Placement</h1>
</section>
<p>In July, the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team hosted a school placement, hosting five students from a London based secondary school to teach them about our work and show them some of the skills they would need to start a career in data science. Liz Kelly describes her experience, working to prepare this week to show the school pupils what our team does, and give them a taste of how it might be to work with us.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience-pd-newsletter/posts/2024_07/school.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Some really happy cartoon kids on a school placement, ready to learn about the NHS England Data Science team.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This was a rewarding yet difficult task, involving a lot of admin, paperwork, and even a conversation with NHS England lawyers to check we were dotting all our i’s and crossing all our t’s. Naturally, after all this, there were still the dreaded tech setup issues (<em>sigh</em>). But Chaeyoon did an amazing job at fixing them in record time, so the students could still get the most out of their placement.</p>
<p>As a graduate in the Data Science team, I know first-hand how valuable it is for colleagues to take time to explain the various cogs in the NHS system. Because let’s be honest, it’s a bit complicated. So, we made sure to cover as many areas as possible to help with this understanding.</p>
<p>About half of the data scientists (a total of 22) met students during the placement week, alongside more indirect engagements from others such as helping with the training materials. The students rotated through four data science teams and were introduced to two methods of data science ways of working: python programming and collaborative works on GitHub. At the end of the placement week, they had a mock interview and an optional task to build a classifier function with if-else conditions to find which group (from the placement sessions) they could match to the session information. It is incredible to think some of the students had never touched programming before and yet, by the end of the week, they had a basic understanding of Python!</p>
<p>I personally enjoyed the challenge of organising the timetable for the students and leading them through workshops and career talks. Who doesn’t love a good to-do list! And since I don’t cover this kind of outreach in my day-to-day role, this was an excellent opportunity. I could tick off those leadership and mentoring competencies, not to mention dealing with complexity (those pesky access and tech issues). I will admit, teaching a group over Teams is trickier than I thought, especially interactive sessions. The students were eager to discuss and answer questions but sometimes their meeting room microphone didn’t quite catch what they were saying … or perhaps it was just me and the London accent.</p>
<p>As this was the first of its kind, it took a while to discover all the rules and policies. Now we have done this once, subsequent placements should be a lot easier to host. We have collated the resources used <a href="https://github.com/nhsengland/PD_kanban_board/blob/main/PD%20Outreach/Host%20a%20placement.md" target="_blank">here</a>, currently accessible to those in NHSE DS GitHub team. We are working to collate and publish our resources more widely in the future.</p>
<p>As soon as we say “I work for the NHS”, peoples first thoughts are frontline staff, not data scientists. It wasn’t until I was graduating university that I stumbled across data science roles in the NHS and even then, it was purely accidental. When I think back to my time at school I would have loved to do this work experience week in the NHS.</p>
<p>I know I am not alone when I say just how important it is to introduce young people to Data Science, particularly in the NHS. This provides them with more avenues to follow and more ideas of what is out there. It makes the world of possibilities just that bit bigger.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to everyone involved. I’m sure you’ll agree the placement week was a success, just perhaps short of a few tea and biscuit breaks. The students are not used to being at a desk all day!</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday 13th August 2024, 13:00 - 14:00, Online</strong></p>
<p>The recent explosion on the scene of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) is creating a vast array of opportunities. There is more than one way to leverage this recent breakthrough. You can create a chatbot by directly “plugging” to a LLM and start asking questions. However, LLMs are limited to the information available in the data they have seen during their training. So how to build a chatbot that will be able to answer questions related to documents that the model has never seen. One solution is to use a technique called “Retrieval Augmented Generation” (RAG). After an introduction of Generative AI and transformers, we will go through the RAG logic and explore its benefits and potential drawbacks. The talk is intended for anyone interested in generative AI and its potential applications.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday 20th Aug 2024, 15:30 - 17:00, Virtual Seminar</strong></p>
<p>The theme of this T-SciM event will be explainable AI (XAI). This refers to a range of approaches that seek to design or evaluate ways to make the outputs of artificial intelligence algorithms more interpretable. Such explainability is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying the models computations and determine how trustworthy and generalisable their results are.</p>
<p>We will be joined by 3 speakers, who will give short talks introducing their work on XAI, followed by a panel discussion with questions and prompts from the audience.</p>
<p>Speakers include: Dr Ahmed Salih, Dr Tapabrata (Rohan) Chakraborty and Sophie Martin (ex-PhD intern with the NHSE DS team).</p>

<section id="interview-with-a-data-scientist" class="level1 section-heading">
<h1>Interview with a Data Scientist</h1>
</section>
<p>Mia Noonan is a Senior Data Scientist in the NHS England Data Science team, who first joined the company as a member of the 2021 graduate cohort.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for agreeing to be the first “Interview with a Data Scientist” for the PD newsletter! I was wondering, could you tell me a bit about your background and what motivated you to pursue a career in data science in the NHS?</strong></p>
<p>M: I did economics and politics at Uni, but after a year in finance thought this isn’t for me as I didn’t really gel with the sort of work that I was doing at the time. In contrast, I found myself really interested by the work that the IT department was doing because I could see the impact that it had on my day-to-day. For example, there was one task where I had to process a load of invoices and that would take me all afternoon and then one day they just went, <em>“Oh yeah, we’ve automated that”</em> and I was like <em>“what?!”</em> – and immediately wanted to be on the side which was doing that!</p>
<p>So that was one of my main motivations to go into computer science, and I decided to do a computer science Master’s at Bath. It was quite an intense year, but it gave me the upskilling that I needed to go into more technical roles. I got introduced to data science right at the end of that year from my final research project. It was an NLP project where I had to analyse the transcription of everything that’s said in parliament, to understand where MPs are focusing their attention. I really enjoyed it because it was a bridge between economics, politics and computer science.</p>
<p>Once I did that project I thought, <em>yeah, this is this is super cool, this is exactly where I want to be</em>. Someone I was speaking to mentioned that there was a data science team in the NHS and I was like <em>wow, I didn’t know</em> - but immediately wanted to be a part of it! I was lucky enough to get a placement in the data science team through the NHS Digital graduate scheme, and the rest is history…!</p>
<p><strong>What specific professional development tools or resources did you find most helpful in skilling up on your time of the graduate scheme?</strong></p>
<p>M: I had Kin as a line manager, so that was great. He was very, very good at articulating <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals" target="_blank">SMART goals</a>, and I think that really helped because the goals were so well laid out, a lot of the competencies I could just tick off on the job due to the variety of work in the data linkage enhancement team. I was lucky with my placement, my line manager, and had a lot of the things I could just do on the job, which was great.</p>
<p>In terms of technical skills, <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> would be my bread and butter in terms of a tool and a resource to turn to just to upskill. If I’m like <em>“oh, I don’t know what an S3 bucket is, I need to do some AWS training”</em>, if there’s a specific technical skill I need to learn, I’d go to that.</p>
<p>I think I find that I probably sometimes upskill a little bit easier when I’m doing something on the job and practically applying it straight away. I really try and actively seek out the opportunities to go and upskill in other areas. I try not to be passive about my development goals and seek out the opportunities, and if there’s something that interests me, follow up on it.</p>
<p><strong>What keeps you motivated and passionate about your work and data science with the NHS?</strong></p>
<p>M: It’s really exciting just being able to continuously learn new things and be on the forefront of new disruptive technologies. I like the fact that the work we’re doing is making a real difference to the NHS, it’s great.</p>
<p>Being surrounded by such great team members also makes a big difference. The team has got so much knowledge inside of it that it’s easy to organically learn things from people. It’s a positive learning environment and has a culture of safety and openness, there’s no one in the team I would feel hesitant going to ask a question to.</p>
<p>And then also having that culture of wanting everyone to do well, makes you want to do well because you want to contribute back and create that positive cycle for the whole team and feel like you’re contributing towards that.</p>
<p><strong>The current graduates will be embarking on their End of Scheme in the next fortnight or so. What is a piece of advice that you have for them?</strong></p>
<p>M: In terms of something that’s relevant to this point in terms of their career and passing their End of Scheme I would say that my biggest piece of advice would be don’t stop being curious about things. They’ve had a really intense upskilling period where they’ve gone through two years of intense rotations, being exposed to those different areas, but don’t stop that momentum just because you’ve rolled off the scheme. Go out, speak to loads of different teams, different people, keep networking. Keep trying different projects, different things because you’ll learn more and more about what interests and motivates you, because two years sounds like a long time, but it’s really short.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday 21st May, 12-1pm, Online</strong></p>
<p>This session outlines work by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ)’s Better Outcomes through Linked Data (BOLD) programme Homelessness Pilot colleagues in Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). The Better Outcomes through Linked Data programme aims to demonstrate the benefits of linked data across government. In DLUHC’s Homelessness Pilot Team, our challenge was a lack of full data access for sensitivity reasons. To overcome this, we developed a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) for our offending and repeat homelessness projects. For the rough sleeping and drug treatment project, we took a pragmatic approach to writing a report using only aggregated data that was suppressed.</p>
<p>We shall talk about our approaches, including constructing dummy data, modular coding using Quarto (an alternative to RMarkdown) and robust statistical methods such as trimmed means.</p>

<p>On Thursday 11th April we had our first Data Science discussion, hosted by Will Poulett. Data Science Discussions are a new event, focussed on peer to peer discussions on a broad range of Data Science topics. For this discussion Will asked everyone attending to research a future application of AI that interested them, and also consider how it could be later applied to healthcare. The discussion began with Will presenting his case: <a href="https://www.projectceti.org/" target="_blank">Project CETI</a>, who are applying advanced machine learning and state-of-the-art robotics to listen to and translate the communication of sperm whales. Check out his slide deck <a href="https://nhs.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/msteams_2768a1/Shared%20Documents/FT%20-%20Professional%20Development/PD%20Events/Data%20Science%20Discussions?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=Tbm3Gq" target="_blank">here</a>. We then broke up into smaller groups to further discuss his case and our own.</p>
<p>The Professional Development Functional Team hope to hold Data Science Discussions monthly. If you have an area of Data Science you’re interested in sharing, and encouraging others to look into too, please <a href="mailto:datascience@nhs.net">contact us</a> to host a session! Most of the session is held in break out rooms, and so all you need to do is spark discussion.</p>

<p>NHS England has <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/leaders/" target="_blank">published the leadership competency framework</a> which comprises a set of leadership competencies incorporating the skills, values and behaviours required in NHS board roles and establishes what good looks like in leadership terms, providing a new and consistent national standard of leadership. Many of us are very far from those positions, but it does not hurt to aim high. But also, it is good to know what is expected of our leaders. These are the six leadership competency domains that you can learn about reading the framework:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Driving high-quality and sustainable outcomes</li>
<li>Setting strategy and delivering long-term transformation</li>
<li>Promoting equality and inclusion, and reducing health and workforce inequalities</li>
<li>Providing robust governance and assurance</li>
<li>Creating a compassionate, just and positive culture</li>
<li>Building a trusted relationship with partners and communities</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generative-ai-in-a-research-context">Generative AI in a research context</h3>
<p>Generative AI is increasingly used to draft, edit, annotate and debug code. It’s not just industry software developers who are taking advantage of the tools it has to offer. Those who develop and use software for academic research are benefitting from them too. So how do you make the best use of generative AI for coding in a research context? As software engineers with The Alan Turing Institute’s <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering-group" target="_blank">Research Engineering Group</a> (REG) and <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment" target="_blank">PhD Enrichment scheme</a>, we’ve been asking ourselves just this question. <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/using-generative-ai-write-code-guide-researchers" target="_blank">Here</a>, we share our thoughts, along with some tips for researchers.</p>

<p>GitHub and GitLab are two very similar yet different platforms and that can lead to some confusion between teams who are familiar with one but not the other when some key pieces of terminology have been changed slightly between them. The RAP Community of Pracice have recently released a quick summary of some of these terminology differences. Read over this and you’ll never get your MRs and PRs mixed up again!</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="competency-framework-zooming-intodelivery"><u><strong>Competency Framework</strong> – zooming into…Delivery</u></h4>
<p>As we adjust to delivering in the new team structure; using potentially unfamiliar tools like Confluence, JIRA and DevOps, getting to grips with new projects and new stakeholders, it’s the perfect time to refresh our understanding of what makes good delivery.</p>
<p>Delivery is the translation of the insights we produce into actionable outcomes. Keeping a delivery-focussed mindset is key to achieve value for money and improve lives for service users. Without it, we cannot fulfil our mission to drive the digital transformation of the NHS!</p>
<p>Delivery comes in different shapes and sizes, whether it’s being accountable for your own tickets or ensuring your team is focused on the top priorities – each of us play our part.</p>
<p>Check out these top tips from our <a href="https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/DAT/Data+Science+Competency+Framework" target="_blank">Competency Framework</a>❗ :</p>
<ul>
<li>Break down complex objectives into clear tasks to deliver incremental value with each iteration</li>
<li>Regularly sync-up with stakeholders to understand priorities and manage delivery expectations</li>
<li>Be a role model to others by demonstrating a focus on delivery, whilst being open to new ideas and continuous improvement</li>
</ul>
