<h1>Interview with a Data Scientist - The RAP Guy</h1>
</section>
<p>Welcome to another installment of our “Interview with a Data Scientist” series, where we explore the careers and work of the talented members of the NHS England Data Science team. We aim to showcase the fantastic individuals who contribute to the NHSE Data Science Profession and provide valuable insights for those considering a career in Data Science within the healthcare sector.</p>
<p>This week our interviewee is Sam Hollings, who is departing NHS England after a seven-year career. In his most recent role as Head of Coding and Data Standards (and formerly as Principal Data Scientist), Sam was a driving force for improving data practices across the organisation. He is widely known for his passionate championing of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP). As he prepares for a new chapter in Italy with his family, he kindly agreed to share his reflections and the lessons learned from his work.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-did-you-end-up-in-data-science-at-the-nhs-what-did-you-do-before-and-what-really-sparked-your-interest-in-this-field">How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?</h3>
<p>I kind of ended up in data science by accident, though each part of my career has related to data, and usually making sense of large quantities of data!</p>
<p>My degree was in Physics and Astronomy, with the final project on hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies and analysing their outputs. This involved a bunch of big data analysis (in Python), but back in 2011 it was the early days of what we now call data science, so I didn’t know this term. I did do some clustering and regression though!</p>
<p>I further professionalised my data skills as a Band 5 in the NHS Information Centre and, crucially, built up my knowledge about NHS secondary care data and the structure of the NHS. Changing to the PhD for the next four years probably wasn’t the wisest choice career-wise, but I wanted to do some work nearer patients. Working in a hospital and picking up bone samples actually taken from patients was really interesting. Again, I also further developed my big data skills through my genomics work and the clustering I did to make sense of the 50,000 genes I measured.</p>
<p>When I came back to the NHSIC (now called the HSCIC, which later became NHS Digital), I built up my programming skills in the data engineering team, but had started to develop a plan to move into the exciting and growing field of data science. I did a bunch of personal study and projects, and then when I got made redundant, I saw my chance. Through the internal process to find me a new job, I got reallocated to the data science team in London! I was really excited by this, as the NHS has some incredibly rich (and huge) patient data, and the chance to apply these new and developing techniques for the benefit of patients and the public was too good to pass up!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="once-you-joined-the-nhs-what-was-that-experience-like-what-different-roles-and-teams-have-you-been-a-part-of-and-how-have-they-shaped-your-career">Once you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?</h3>
<p>I’ve worked on and off for the NHS since 2011, with a break between late 2013 and late 2018 where I did my PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) - though I also worked in a hospital during that time, St James’s in Leeds.</p>
<p>Though my degree was in Astronomy, in the final year I started to take a real interest in health and aspired to be a Medical Physicist. I did a few work experience placements in Radiology and Medical Physics departments. I didn’t get onto the scientist training programme unfortunately, so the first proper job I got after uni was at “the NHS Information Centre” (NHSIC) as a Band 5 Data Engineer (though back then they were called “Information Analysts”, oddly) in the reference data team. I’ll be honest, I kind of blagged my interview as my SQL knowledge was not great (they didn’t care about Python!), but I was a quick learner and soon was helping contribute and improve things. Automating the processes that brought reference data files into a corporate database wasn’t glamorous, but it was impactful, and I learnt so much about production products, working with people who felt you were threatening their job, and crucially, helping them see the opportunities this type of automation can bring. I got promoted to Band 6 after one year, then after another year I felt the itch to return to academia, so I embarked on my PhD.</p>
<p>I did a four-year Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, eventually focussing on studying how doping a type of bioactive glass-ceramic with Strontium made it “osteoinductive”. I did do proper cell biology work in a lab (and got to see a whole room of sawn-in-half cadavers), but the part I enjoyed most was the big data analysis of the genomics experiments I did, and again, helping my biology colleagues write programmes to automate some of their repetitive image processing.</p>
<p>At the end of the PhD I was a bit burnt out from research, so I came back to my old team as a Band 7 Data Engineer in the NHSIC (now called the HSCIC, which later became NHS Digital) where Python was now in vogue. I really learnt a lot about how to programme professionally - code version control, tests, pulling data down from Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), dev, test, live, the works! I then got made redundant, and through the internal process to find me a new job I got reallocated to the data science team in London!</p>
<p>Over the next five years, I established myself as a data scientist, getting promoted to Band 8a and working on a number of different projects - COVID patient forecasting, helping set up the Trusted Research Environment (TRE) - I was the original TRE Data Wrangler in the business! - and spending almost three years spreading Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) alongside a great number of incredible colleagues.</p>
<p>The final chapter of my career here was moving to Data Architecture where I continued the legacy of the RAP work, establishing coding and data standards in the business.</p>

<section id="what-are-you-currently-working-on-are-there-any-projects-that-youre-particularly-excited-about-or-that-you-feel-are-making-a-real-difference-what-impact-are-you-having" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-you-currently-working-on-are-there-any-projects-that-youre-particularly-excited-about-or-that-you-feel-are-making-a-real-difference-what-impact-are-you-having">What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?</h3>
<p>My current work in the Data Architecture team has been mostly about establishing a reusable code library within the business and beyond, with the intention of it being public. You can see our prototype <a href="https://github.com/nhsengland/Reusable-Code-Library/tree/main" target="_blank">here</a>! Many people in the business write the same old code… like how there are 20-something different algorithms for NHS number validation. We just need ONE - agreed, made to a high standard, signed off, and easy to consume. Alongside this, I’ve been working with others to clarify open sourcing, code documentation, code metadata, and reusable code standards, so it’s easier for our colleagues to adopt best practice.</p>
<p>Alongside this, I’ve led the work on establishing some Data Principles for NHS England. These are basic statements, often quite obvious, that act as a guiding light for how we use data. Ours are not published yet, but <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/datastrategy/dataprinciples" target="_blank">a great example is the data principles released by the ONS</a>.</p>
<p>I also spent a while doing work on LLMs and other AI tools, including going to work for Downing Street for two months on an AI taskforce building a RAG-based tool for the Deputy Prime Minister. I tried to bring this learning back and share it with our colleagues through this interactive notebook: <a href="https://github.com/SamHollings/llm_tutorial" target="_blank">LLM Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Probably the project I’m most well known for is “Reproducible Analytical Pipelines” (RAP). I really <a href="https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/history_of_RAP/" target="_blank">rode on the coat-tails of others</a>, with colleagues such as Connor Quinn and Helen Richardson really getting it going in NHS Digital. My team and I focussed on helping people and making RAP interesting and fun, such as by having Christmas-themed sets of posts about RAP, and by challenging ourselves to mention it in nearly every meeting, including All Hands Calls! We trained a number of teams, who themselves went on to train others, so probably hundreds of analysts benefited from our work, and this isn’t even counting the teams from other organisations in London, Canada, France, and elsewhere who adopted our guidance! This work was really rewarding as it genuinely helped our colleagues. We managed to help colleagues reduce some pieces of work that took two people two weeks to run, to only take one person 40 minutes! We also tracked the success of the programme by measuring how many teams had reached <a href="https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/" target="_blank">baseline, silver, and gold RAP</a>, and tracking how this changed each month, focussing our efforts on where people were getting stuck.</p>
<p>In terms of communication, I’m a big fan of using humour to make even the driest subject interesting. You have to use it sparingly, but when used at the right point, it can really help you hammer home the points you’re trying to make. I also use a lot of metaphors, describing technical things in terms of chocolate bars, cakes, vehicles - anything which allows me to get the core idea across in a way people can understand, and that feels real to them.</p>

And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?</h3>
<p>The most important advice is just start playing with the tools and having a go. Sign up to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, do their free training, have a go at a few competitions, but then find a real-world problem or some real-world data and start your own project. Learn step by step by reading on Medium, or via books or other sources. It’s how many of us have picked up data science!</p>

<p>We hope you found this interview with Sam Hollings interesting. His journey demonstrates how curiosity, persistence, and a passion for making complex topics accessible can transform not just individual careers, but entire organisations. Sam’s work on RAP has improved the way hundreds of analysts work across the NHS and beyond, proving that technical excellence combined with humour and effective communication can drive real cultural change.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday 5th November, 10:00 - 16:00, Aspire Leeds, 2 Infirmary St, Leeds LS1 2JP</strong></p>
<p>Regional government holds a range of powers and responsibilities that have the potential to improve people’s health. These include action on employment, the environment, housing, transport, and the economy. The government’s devolution agenda presents a vital opportunity for both newly established and existing Strategic Authorities to consider how they can maximize these powers to improve the health of their populations and reduce health inequalities.</p>
<p>This free one-day conference will be led by the Health Foundation, with support from the Mayoral Regions Programme (run on behalf of 10 Mayoral Strategic Authorities by the West Midlands Combined Authority). It will bring together colleagues from Strategic Authorities and their partners from across England to explore how regional leadership can drive better health outcomes.</p>
<p>The event will provide an opportunity to discuss embedding health in all policies in Mayoral Regions, working in partnership to improve health, and delivering local growth for health. We will explore examples of good practice, highlight opportunities and challenges, and offer space to learn from peers.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday 6th November, 09:30 - 11:00, Online</strong></p>
<p>Birmingham City Council have developed and run the Birmingham City Observatory, a public, open data platform on a wide range of characteristics of the city. Danny O’Neill, its creator, is an expert on building Power BI dashboards.<br>
Want your Power BI reports to guide users, not just display data? In this hands-on session, we’ll explore how to create interactive onboarding tutorials right inside your reports using layers, bookmarks, and clever design tricks. Whether you’re introducing new dashboards or making complex reports more user-friendly, you’ll learn practical ways to build guided experiences that actually stick.</p>
<p>Perfect for Power BI developers, analysts, and anyone who wants their reports to speak for themselves.</p>
<p>This event is free and open to all; however, we anticipate it will be of most interest to anyone working with Power BI dashboards to analyse data.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday 11th November, 12:00 - 13:00, Online</strong><br>
<strong>Wednesday 26th November, 13:00 - 14:00, Online</strong></p>
<p>Join us at the Data Ethics &amp; Society Reading Group to discuss Privacy is Power by Carissa Véliz.</p>
<p>“Digital technology is stealing our personal data and with it our power to make free choices. To reclaim that power and democracy, we must protect our privacy. Short, terrifying, practical: Privacy is Power highlights the implications of our laid-back attitude to data and sets out how we can take back control.”</p>
<p>We will be holding two sessions over two weeks. The sessions will each focus on a different section of the book- but if you can’t make the one you want to come to, we can still guarantee a great conversation! Read more about our changes in our recent <a href="https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2025/02/17/data-ethics-and-society-join-the-conversation-in-2025/" target="_blank">Data in Government blog post</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tue 11 Nov 2025 12 PM - 1 PM (focusing on the first half of the book; the dangers the data economy poses and why we should care)</li>
<li>Wed 26 Nov 2025 1 PM - 2 PM (focusing on the second half of the book; what can we do about it, and whose responsibility is it?)</li>
</ul>
<p>The event is free, but you need to sign up to reserve your spot. Signups for the first session will close on Monday 3rd November at 6pm. Signups for the second session close on Tuesday 18th November at 6pm.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday 27th November, 09:15 - 10:30, Online</strong></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Dan Olner is a Y-PERN policy fellow and spatial economic data nerd based in the School of Management at Sheffield University.</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll work through some examples of using R to extract data directly from web sources (like NOMIS and online Excel sheets) and create pipelines through to final outputs. Automating as many of the steps as possible can be a huge help for quickly replicating and sharing analysis, and updating quickly when new data is published (though we’ll also discuss how to deal with inevitable format changes). Common ONS economic datasets will be used. Some familiarity with R will be useful, though you should be able to run all code without. If you want a quick R primer prior to the session, see Dan’s previous ‘R for economic data’ taster session (linked on the event webpage).</p>
<p>This free workshop is open to everyone, but will be particularly suited to data analysts who are responsible for creating, maintaining and developing dashboards and other data outputs for local authorities.</p>
