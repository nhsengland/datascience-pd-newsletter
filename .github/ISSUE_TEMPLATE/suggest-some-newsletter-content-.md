## ðŸš€ Thank you for contributing to our newsletter! ðŸŽ‰

We welcome all suggestions, from quick links to articles, events and documentation to slightly longer pieces (as long as they would fit within the newsletter, maximum 300 words please!).

We write the newsletter in markdown, and would much appreciate if you could do the same with your content suggestion if it's more than a quick link. You can see a quick cheatsheet to markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

If your suggestion works well with our upcoming newsletter we will do our best to add it in! Please note we might make some edits in order to make it fit into our format.
