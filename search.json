    "text": "Welcome to the latest newsletter from the Data Science Community for Health and Care, brought to you by the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team.\nThe newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.\nIf you cannot access something of interest to you, please reach out.\nThanks for reading! – newsletter team\n\nInterview with a Data Scientist - The Data Scientist Who Just Wanted to Make Plots\n\nWelcome to another insightful installment of our “Interview with a Data Scientist” series. Here, we delve into the diverse career paths and impactful work of the talented individuals who make up the NHS England Data Science team. Our goal is to shine a light on the fantastic people driving the NHS Data Science Profession forward and to offer valuable perspectives for anyone considering a career in healthcare data science.\nThis week our interviewee is Amaia Imaz Blanco, a Data Scientist in the Data Science Team whose love of making graphs led her to the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme and eventually into probabilistic data linkage!\n\n\nRead more…\n\n\nHow did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nI wouldn’t say I had a grand plan to get into data science — but looking back, it probably isn’t a huge surprise. When I was asked what I wanted to be at age 11, I said “a maths teacher,” which felt a bit out of step with the dreams of astronauts and footballers around me. That early love for numbers truly set the stage for my academic and professional life.\nFast forward to being 16, and I stumbled upon the existence of an Astrophysics degree. From that moment, that became the goal. I’ve always loved to describe astrophysics as “just maths with pretty pictures,” and honestly, what’s not to love about that combination? In 2018, fresh out of school, I embarked on a Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology MPhys at Lancaster University. My Masters project involved a deep dive into a dataset of 40,000 galaxies, performing extensive classification and statistical analysis. However, my very first taste of what I now recognise as data science techniques came during an internship at The University of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy. There, I used Markov-Chain Monte Carlo modelling to understand the shapes and densities of debris and dust around exoplanets, which even led to this published paper.\nNearing the end of my university studies, a significant realisation dawned on me: despite my enthusiasm for my degree and for astrophysics as a whole, I just wanted to contribute to something that had a tangible impact in the “real world.” So, I dove into the job market, applying to almost every role that claimed to welcome physics graduates, though with limited success. It was during a moment of frustration that my mum suggested: “Amaia, you love understanding complicated topics through reading and making graphs, why don’t you look for jobs where you can do that?”\nThat simple question was a revelation. It completely shifted my perspective, and I began searching for data-focused roles. That’s how I discovered the NHS Digital graduate scheme. It felt like the perfect alignment – an opportunity to explore a data career within a broader technical scheme, which meant I wasn’t locked into a single path. Crucially, it offered the chance to make a real difference for real people, within an organisation I deeply believe in.\n\n\nOnce you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?\nI’ve now been with the NHS for nearly three years, beginning my journey at NHS Digital before its merger with NHS England. Over half of this time has been dedicated to data science roles. My initial placement at NHS Digital was within an analytics team in the Secondary Care area, where I primarily worked with Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) data.\nFor my second placement, I decided to venture into something completely different, joining the Run & Maintain team in the NHS App as a software developer. It quickly became clear that this wasn’t my forte; I wasn’t very good at it, nor did I truly enjoy it. After spending a year at the NHS, observing my fellow grad, Will, creating “cool plots” for the CVD Pathways project, I decided that the team that he was in might be a good match. For my final placement, I decided to join the Data Science Team myself. I’ve since successfully graduated from the grad scheme and am now a permanent member of the Data Science and Applied AI Team.\n\n\nWhat are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nCurrently, I’m deeply involved with the Data Linkage Hub, specifically focusing on the probabilistic data linkage pipeline. This project utilises a probabilistic model designed to accurately identify records belonging to the same patient, using their demographic information. The reason this project excites me so much is its foundational importance to almost all data work within our organisation. We handle immense volumes of data, and without the ability to reliably link records to individual patients, combining datasets to understand patient pathways would be fundamentally impossible. Accurate data linkage underpins the precision of our publications, the robustness of research studies, and ultimately, the efficacy of direct patient care. This is why I’ve been dedicated to this project since joining the team, and why I continue to be enthusiastic about its impact.\nI also lead our Marketing & Comms function team, where we focus on making sure people know about the work we’re doing, the impact it’s having, and the wide range of skills across the team. It’s a part of the role I really enjoy: I get to shout about work I genuinely believe in. You can get a flavour of it from the data science website I help run here.\n\n\nIf you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?\nI believe that, more so now than even a couple of years ago when I started, there’s a strong temptation for people to apply AI and machine learning to every single problem. And as ironic as it might sound coming from someone whose job revolves around developing these products, one of the most invaluable skills I’ve got is the ability to critically assess a situation and determine when data science techniques are, in fact, not the optimal solution. Being able to think critically about the ethical implications and the practical usefulness – or lack thereof – of these products, in my opinion, makes me a more valuable team member and a more effective data scientist. Therefore, I would always advise anyone starting out to not just read about the benefits of certain techniques, but to dedicate significant time to understanding their pitfalls and limitations first.\nMy second piece of advice is that genuine enthusiasm and enjoyment in your work are the most powerful ways to succeed. Don’t pursue data science simply because it’s a popular or trendy field with growing job opportunities. Instead, figure out what truly brings you joy, be it coding, maths, creating visualisations, or anything else, and then explore how that passion aligns with the role of a data scientist. By doing so, you’ll naturally gravitate towards a niche within the vast landscape of data science, which in turn will make you a more attractive and unique candidate in the job market.\n\nWe hope you found this interview with Amaia Imaz Blanco inspiring. Her journey shows how following your enthusiasm and passions can lead you to doing work you love. You can also view our previous ‘Interview with a Data Scientist’ with Adam Hollings, Dim Sum and Data Science, on the NHS England Data Science Website.\n\n\n\n\nAnalyst X Data Science Huddles reborn!\n\nRecently, the Data Science Community for Health and Care organised a talk on exploring associations in survey data with machine learning and tidymodels. The talk compared using two different machine learning algorithms to explore the results of the General Practice Patient Survey, a national publicly-available dataset.\nMissed the session? Check out the recording and PowerPoint slides here, where you will also find the recordings of previous huddles.\n\n\nAnalyst X DS Huddle: Building the NHSRwaitinglist package\n\n22nd of July 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online\nThe Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for July! The talk will cover building the NHSRwaitinglist package. Have a read of the abstract below:\nBuilding R packages, or Python libraries, is a great way to share and disseminate your code. The process forces you to think about ‘productionising’ your code, the reproducibility of element, efficiency and the documentation of your code. Interaction with users of a package helps to identify issues, and open coding can encourage communities to fix these issues. This talk will share some of the principles of package building in R, including building functions, documenting functions, unit testing, use of GitHub and releasing a package to CRAN, the most well-known package repository. We will discuss the principles used in building the NHSRwaiting list package, a package to apply calculations and principles from queuing theory to NHS waiting list analysis. This package allows the calculation of target waiting times, understanding queue load, relief capacity required to meet target waiting times, and simple simulation of queues.\nWe have added this event to our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar, where you can find the calendar invite to access the event.\nIf you would like to be invited to future events of ours, sign up to our mailing list!\n\n\nLooking for an interesting read?\n\nThe Nature Journal has a paper on A framework to assess clinical safety and hallucination rates of LLMs for medical text summarisation.\nThe paper looks at how the fidelity between LLM outputs and ground truth information is vital to prevent miscommunication that could lead to compromise in patient safety, and proposes a framework to assess and evaluate these errors.\n\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

See the full calendar here❗\nMia Noonan is a Senior Data Scientist in the NHS England Data Science team, who first joined the company as a member of the 2021 graduate cohort.\nThank you for agreeing to be the first “Interview with a Data Scientist” for the PD newsletter! I was wondering, could you tell me a bit about your background and what motivated you to pursue a career in data science in the NHS?\nM: I did economics and politics at Uni, but after a year in finance thought this isn’t for me as I didn’t really gel with the sort of work that I was doing at the time. In contrast, I found myself really interested by the work that the IT department was doing because I could see the impact that it had on my day-to-day. For example, there was one task where I had to process a load of invoices and that would take me all afternoon and then one day they just went, “Oh yeah, we’ve automated that” and I was like “what?!” – and immediately wanted to be on the side which was doing that!\nSo that was one of my main motivations to go into computer science, and I decided to do a computer science Master’s at Bath. It was quite an intense year, but it gave me the upskilling that I needed to go into more technical roles. I got introduced to data science right at the end of that year from my final research project. It was an NLP project where I had to analyse the transcription of everything that’s said in parliament, to understand where MPs are focusing their attention. I really enjoyed it because it was a bridge between economics, politics and computer science.\nOnce I did that project I thought, yeah, this is this is super cool, this is exactly where I want to be. Someone I was speaking to mentioned that there was a data science team in the NHS and I was like wow, I didn’t know - but immediately wanted to be a part of it! I was lucky enough to get a placement in the data science team through the NHS Digital graduate scheme, and the rest is history…!\nWhat specific professional development tools or resources did you find most helpful in skilling up on your time of the graduate scheme?\nM: I had Kin as a line manager, so that was great. He was very, very good at articulating SMART goals, and I think that really helped because the goals were so well laid out, a lot of the competencies I could just tick off on the job due to the variety of work in the data linkage enhancement team. I was lucky with my placement, my line manager, and had a lot of the things I could just do on the job, which was great.\nIn terms of technical skills, Pluralsight would be my bread and butter in terms of a tool and a resource to turn to just to upskill. If I’m like “oh, I don’t know what an S3 bucket is, I need to do some AWS training”, if there’s a specific technical skill I need to learn, I’d go to that.\nI think I find that I probably sometimes upskill a little bit easier when I’m doing something on the job and practically applying it straight away. I really try and actively seek out the opportunities to go and upskill in other areas. I try not to be passive about my development goals and seek out the opportunities, and if there’s something that interests me, follow up on it.\nWhat keeps you motivated and passionate about your work and data science with the NHS?\nM: It’s really exciting just being able to continuously learn new things and be on the forefront of new disruptive technologies. I like the fact that the work we’re doing is making a real difference to the NHS, it’s great.\nBeing surrounded by such great team members also makes a big difference. The team has got so much knowledge inside of it that it’s easy to organically learn things from people. It’s a positive learning environment and has a culture of safety and openness, there’s no one in the team I would feel hesitant going to ask a question to.\nAnd then also having that culture of wanting everyone to do well, makes you want to do well because you want to contribute back and create that positive cycle for the whole team and feel like you’re contributing towards that.\nThe current graduates will be embarking on their End of Scheme in the next fortnight or so. What is a piece of advice that you have for them?\nM: In terms of something that’s relevant to this point in terms of their career and passing their End of Scheme I would say that my biggest piece of advice would be don’t stop being curious about things. They’ve had a really intense upskilling period where they’ve gone through two years of intense rotations, being exposed to those different areas, but don’t stop that momentum just because you’ve rolled off the scheme. Go out, speak to loads of different teams, different people, keep networking. Keep trying different projects, different things because you’ll learn more and more about what interests and motivates you, because two years sounds like a long time, but it’s really short.\nThis interview was edited for brevity\nHow many tries will it take you?"

This leads to children being exposed to inappropriate or harmful content and risks potential negative impacts on children’s wellbeing.\nYet the research also demonstrates that children are excited about the ways generative AI could be used to support them in their learning and for play, if developed and deployed responsibly.\nOver the course of the “Understanding the impacts of generative AI use on children” project, The Alan Turing Institute’s Children and AI team and AI for Public Services team have explored the perspectives of children, parents, carers and teachers on generative AI technologies. Their research was guided by the framework for children’s online well-being established by the UNICEF project ‘Responsible Innovation in Technology for Children’.\nThis webinar will share the key findings of the project’s two work packages namely, surveys with children, parents, carers and teachers, and school-based engagements undertaken in collaboration with Children’s Parliament. Researchers will share insights into the observed impacts of generative AI on children’s wellbeing and additional insights from teachers about how generative AI is being used within classrooms.\nThis webinar is free to attend; just register and you will receive the link!"

    "text": "ONS Local Workshop: Using R for regional economic analysis, taster session\nTuesday 17th June, 09:30 - 11:00, Online\nThis 90 minute session will introduce using R and RStudio for regional data analysis, with a focus on economic data. No experience with R is necessary. You can attend without coding, but if you’d like to follow along with some economic data wrangling and don’t yet have R/RStudio, please follow this short guide to getting set up with R before the session, and you’ll be ready to go. Using mainly ONS region-by-industry GVA data, we’ll look at wrangling data, making visualisations and other analysis tasks, and using libraries like tidyverse.\nAs well as introducing R, the session will talk about why open and reproducible data analysis can be so valuable, and run through examples of using it to produce pipelines from ONS data through to reports, maps and other outputs. The session will leave time to discuss the pros, cons and challenges of using tools like this, which will help shape future R training sessions.\nThe session is free and a ticket is required."

    "text": "How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nI studied chemistry at the University of Leeds; after my undergraduate degree, I stayed on to pursue a PhD in organic chemistry.\nMy research focused on peptides and proteins, which meant a significant amount of time in the lab, and more time than I’d like to recall spent washing glassware! However, a turning point came when the department acquired a robot to run experiments. This was my first real immersion in programming and data handling.\nTowards the end of my PhD, I came across a job advertisement for the Government Operational Research Service (GORS), a service often considered a precursor to modern data science. I applied and was placed within the Department of Health.\nI’ve remained within the health sector and the realm of data ever since, for about 17 years now, although I’ve had the opportunity to work in many different areas.\nMy passion for data science truly ignited around 2016, and I took the initiative to establish a small data science team within the Department of Health. Since then, I’ve held a variety of roles across the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), NHS England, and NHSX. I also spent some valuable time at Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust and in a data policy role. Ultimately, though, leading a data science team is where my true passion lies."

    "text": "What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nAs Deputy Director of the Data Science team at NHS England, my focus has shifted from direct project involvement to leading the team and shaping its strategic direction. While I miss the day-to-day project work, I now dedicate my time to raising the team’s profile and securing new opportunities for us to contribute.\nTwo current areas of work particularly excite me. Firstly, the ongoing development of data science as a recognised profession within the NHS.\nFor example, our PhD intern programme, which connects the NHS with early-career researchers in academia, has been running successfully for several years (more information can be found here). This initiative brings fresh perspectives and skills into the NHS.\nWe also now oversee a Data Science Masters programme, a fantastic opportunity to provide advanced training to our colleagues, enhancing their capabilities and the overall data science capacity within the NHS.\nI was also involved in developing the data science competency frameworks and, more recently, a continuous professional development policy. I firmly believe that having a clear, fair, well-defined, and well-promoted profession is crucial for attracting and retaining talent and ensuring high standards.\nMore recently, I’ve had the rewarding experience of engaging in school outreach. The sessions at primary schools were particularly memorable; the children’s questions are often wonderfully wild, funny, and insightful!\nThe second area that truly excites me is shaping the new projects coming into the team. I’m particularly keen to see how data science can effectively support the digital transformation initiatives within the NHS, as well as inform crucial operational decisions.\nIt’s fascinating to observe how different teams operate and identify how data science can provide valuable assistance. I play a key role in scoping these projects to ensure they not only meet but potentially exceed the initial requirements.\nIncreasingly, we’re seeing colleagues interested in leveraging the power of AI in their work, which brings exciting new challenges, opportunities, and collaborations for our team."

    "text": "If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?\nMy advice for aspiring data scientists would be two things:\nFirstly, cultivate the ability to explain complex, technical, and potentially dry subjects in a simple and engaging manner. Think to yourself, ‘Can I explain what I’m doing to a 9-year-old in a way that they would not only understand but also find captivating?’ Channel your inner kids’ TV presenter or science journalist!\nA great way to achieve this is by using everyday analogies. Try comparing a project, process, or problem to a familiar, everyday situation. Recently, when explaining technical concepts, I’ve used examples like visiting a restaurant or using an iPhone.\nIf you can help people, feel intelligent (rather than prioritising making yourself appear intelligent!), they are far more likely to engage with and remember what you’re trying to convey.\nIt’s natural, after completing a complex piece of work, to want to highlight its difficulty and intricacy. While sometimes this is necessary, generally, strive to find common ground and make the concepts accessible.\nSecondly, ensure you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of the data science technique or approach you’re using, including its potential weaknesses as well as its strengths compared to other methods.\nIn an age where we can execute complicated processes and code with a few clicks, it’s not always mandatory to delve into the underlying statistical models. However, to build your own confidence and effectively explain your work to others, this understanding of the fundamentals is, for me, paramount. It also equips you to critically evaluate the next ‘new big thing’ that emerges. Aim to be a cynical optimist in your approach.\n\nWe hope you found this interview with Sarah Culkin insightful. Her journey and advice offer valuable perspectives for those interested in contributing to the growing field of data science within the NHS.

The team had various talks, posters and workshops delivered at the conference about our work and projects. Warren Davies reports back.\n\n\n\nNHS England RAP Star Warren Davies giving a talk at HACA on RAP Principles\n\n\nAt the HACA conference 2024 I gave a talk on RAP to a huge crowd, over 4,000 people, great people, the best people. OK more like 70. And I also helped run workshops on Python and RAP. I highly recommend the experience overall. I gained the following XP:\n\n+10 Planning – it’s tricky to plan when you don’t know in advance the size and experience of the audience (in the workshops we opted to give a flavour of what was possible, along with some simple exercises people could follow along with).\n+10 Schmoozing – it is actually very easy. People are very happy to talk about their work and how you might be able to help them.\n+20 Resilience – public speaking can be nerve wracking but that is OK, it’s just weakness leaving the body.\n\nBut you also have the opportunity to help other people. It’s easy to take for granted in NHS England that we basically have a huge bunch of geniuses at our beck and call that that we can pester and learn from every day. But not every analyst in the wider NHS and health world is so lucky. Within trusts and regional organisations, there are often small teams - or even individuals - who do similar work to us but don’t have the kind of support we do.\nWith events like HACA we have the chance to connect with them, and point them to resources and communities they might not know about. Which not only helps them, but gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside too (incidentally, it also ticks a whole load of those “Sharing knowledge” boxes on the competency framework…).\nYou should definitely go next time. You will build your networking skills, help people out, and get loads of great examples you can use when you apply for that promotion. Plus, everyone loves a road trip right?\n\nSchool Placement\n\nIn July, the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team hosted a school placement, hosting five students from a London based secondary school to teach them about our work and show them some of the skills they would need to start a career in data science. Liz Kelly describes her experience, working to prepare this week to show the school pupils what our team does, and give them a taste of how it might be to work with us.\n\n\n\nSome really happy cartoon kids on a school placement, ready to learn about the NHS England Data Science team.\n\n\nThis was a rewarding yet difficult task, involving a lot of admin, paperwork, and even a conversation with NHS England lawyers to check we were dotting all our i’s and crossing all our t’s. Naturally, after all this, there were still the dreaded tech setup issues (sigh). But Chaeyoon did an amazing job at fixing them in record time, so the students could still get the most out of their placement.\nAs a graduate in the Data Science team, I know first-hand how valuable it is for colleagues to take time to explain the various cogs in the NHS system. Because let’s be honest, it’s a bit complicated. So, we made sure to cover as many areas as possible to help with this understanding.\nAbout half of the data scientists (a total of 22) met students during the placement week, alongside more indirect engagements from others such as helping with the training materials. The students rotated through four data science teams and were introduced to two methods of data science ways of working: python programming and collaborative works on GitHub. At the end of the placement week, they had a mock interview and an optional task to build a classifier function with if-else conditions to find which group (from the placement sessions) they could match to the session information. It is incredible to think some of the students had never touched programming before and yet, by the end of the week, they had a basic understanding of Python!\nI personally enjoyed the challenge of organising the timetable for the students and leading them through workshops and career talks. Who doesn’t love a good to-do list! And since I don’t cover this kind of outreach in my day-to-day role, this was an excellent opportunity. I could tick off those leadership and mentoring competencies, not to mention dealing with complexity (those pesky access and tech issues). I will admit, teaching a group over Teams is trickier than I thought, especially interactive sessions. The students were eager to discuss and answer questions but sometimes their meeting room microphone didn’t quite catch what they were saying … or perhaps it was just me and the London accent.\nAs this was the first of its kind, it took a while to discover all the rules and policies. Now we have done this once, subsequent placements should be a lot easier to host. We have collated the resources used here, currently accessible to those in NHSE DS GitHub team. We are working to collate and publish our resources more widely in the future.\nAs soon as we say “I work for the NHS”, peoples first thoughts are frontline staff, not data scientists. It wasn’t until I was graduating university that I stumbled across data science roles in the NHS and even then, it was purely accidental. When I think back to my time at school I would have loved to do this work experience week in the NHS.\nI know I am not alone when I say just how important it is to introduce young people to Data Science, particularly in the NHS. This provides them with more avenues to follow and more ideas of what is out there. It makes the world of possibilities just that bit bigger.\nOnce again, thank you to everyone involved. I’m sure you’ll agree the placement week was a success, just perhaps short of a few tea and biscuit breaks. The students are not used to being at a desk all day!\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

There is more than one way to leverage this recent breakthrough. You can create a chatbot by directly “plugging” to a LLM and start asking questions. However, LLMs are limited to the information available in the data they have seen during their training. So how to build a chatbot that will be able to answer questions related to documents that the model has never seen. One solution is to use a technique called “Retrieval Augmented Generation” (RAG). After an introduction of Generative AI and transformers, we will go through the RAG logic and explore its benefits and potential drawbacks. The talk is intended for anyone interested in generative AI and its potential applications.\n\n\nTranslational Science Methods Club: Explainable AI\nTuesday 20th Aug 2024, 15:30 - 17:00, Virtual Seminar\nThe theme of this T-SciM event will be explainable AI (XAI). This refers to a range of approaches that seek to design or evaluate ways to make the outputs of artificial intelligence algorithms more interpretable. Such explainability is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying the models computations and determine how trustworthy and generalisable their results are.\nWe will be joined by 3 speakers, who will give short talks introducing their work on XAI, followed by a panel discussion with questions and prompts from the audience.\nSpeakers include: Dr Ahmed Salih, Dr Tapabrata (Rohan) Chakraborty and Sophie Martin (ex-PhD intern with the NHSE DS team).\n\n\nHealth Data Science Seminar Series: Transforming Healthcare: AI in Health Data Science\nThursday 12th September 2024, 14:00 - 15:30, Teams\nThis series of seminars presents an exciting opportunity to hear about recent developments in health data science, generate ideas and help build the health data science community. It is hosted by the ONS’s Data Science Campus and Health Analysis Team in partnership with Health Data Research UK (HDR UK).\nThe Health Data Science Seminar series provides a dedicated space for data scientists, policymakers, health professionals, academics, epidemiologists, statisticians and other members of the data science community to come together and explore the potential of data science, to help improve health and health policy.\nThis event will feature presentations from guest speakers including:\nDr Siegfried Karl Wagner - Ophthalmologist and senior research fellow, University College London Professor Christopher Yau - Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Turing AI Fellow, University of Oxford\n\n\nData Science Festival: Oktoberfest\nSaturday 19th October 2024, 9am-5pm, CodeNode London\nApply for a FREE ballot entry to this years DSF Oktoberfest.

See the full calendar here, and a small selection below.\nLast month we ran another Data Science Discussion, an event where we have a host prepare a topic for discussion and then we split into breakout rooms to allow more people to have their say. These discussions aren’t recorded, we want to make everyone feel as comfortable as possible to discuss their thoughts and ideas on whatever topic we are talking about.\nMost recently our discussion focussed on professional development in our current roles, and how we can support others to take advantage of the opportunities they have.\nOne discussion point that came up in a few groups was the difference between purposeful development time versus just doing the job and where the line is drawn between them. It was felt that a lot of the work we do involves researching and learning about different techniques and methods, and that this could really also be considered professional development.\nA theme that also came up across groups was the lack of time available for dedicated professional development for topics and areas that are separate from the day to day work. A lot of people felt like they had limited time for self-directed study, and that getting the job done took priority which led to professional development taking a back seat. In order to mitigate this, people suggested blocking out calendar time in advance in order to pre-book learning time, although sticking to this can be hard if you’re busy.\nWe had members from various NHS teams present at this discussion and there was also a definite split, with some teams feeling like they were allowed a lot more time and were encouraged to take development opportunities more than others. This highlighted a bit of a difference in team culture, and there was discussion about how those who are allotted more time could support those without.\nThe most engaging discussion point? Whether a hot dog is a sandwich. We’re still split on it.\nWant to get the calendar invite for the next one? Sign up to our mailing list.\nWant to host a Discussion?

These constraints limit their ability to process long sequences effectively, and make it more challenging to achieve stable and efficient training and deployment.\nThis paper delves into these issues and proposes SpikingBrain, a new family of brain-inspired models designed to help combat these challenges. The architecture is based on how biological neurons work in the brain, particularly around their adaptive spiking threshold. This threshold, which can dynamically change, enables event-driven copmutation which can enhance computational efficiency.\n\n\nDefeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference\nReproducibility is a bedrock of scientific progress. However, it’s remarkably difficult to get reproducible results out of large language models (LLMs). For example, you might observe that asking ChatGPT the same question multiple times provides different results. However, even when we adjust the temperature down to 0 (that is, the LLM always chooses the highest probability token, which is called greedy sampling), LLM APIs are still not deterministic in practice.\nA group from the Thinking Machine Lab dive into what contributes to the non-deterministic behaviour of LLMs and explain how to defeat nondeterminism and obtain truly reproducible results in LLM inference. They prompt an LLM to “tell me about Richard Feynman” and found that when batch-invariant kernels are enabled, all 1000 completions are identical!\n\n\nGOSH shares study into AI scribe pilot across nine London NHS sites\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital has shared results around using AI-scribe technology across a nine London NHS sites, evaluating the impact of the TORTUS tool. Key findings included that clinicians spent “nearly a quarter” more time directly with patients, with findings reportedly already being used to shape national policy and inform NHSE guidance on AI-enabled scribing.\nThis article describes the TORTUS AI-scribing tool and discusses how AI-scribing could add clinician capacity per day and increase the number of patients seen per shift.\n\n\nDawn of A New Era of Primary Prevention in Medicine\nRecent groundbreaking reports highlight our newfound potential to prevent diseases\nPrimary Prevention means a disease or condition is averted. Currently, we have secondary prevention in place, for example screening for cancer, which focuses on finding cancer at an early stage. This Ground Truths post is about the new and exciting opportunity for achieving primary prevention, and discusses the profound economic benefit of primary prevention for reducing the cost of treatments. The post references various new papers that have recently come out such as Personal Health Agent, Epigenetic Organ Age Clocks and Continuous Protein Monitoring.\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

    "text": "How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nMy journey to data science at the NHS is a blend of engineering roots, a pandemic pivot, and a strong personal connection to healthcare.\nMy academic background began with an Integrated Master’s in Aerospace Engineering. I was captivated by the problem-solving inherent in understanding how complex systems, particularly aircraft, function. This fascination with engineering persists, as evidenced by my continued interest in aerospace content.\nA pivotal moment that hinted at my future direction occurred during a second-year Business Simulation module. We were tasked with managing car companies within a simulated European market. I developed a comprehensive spreadsheet to optimise production, enabling us to create cost-effective cars with popular features. I would go on to make many more spreadsheets, including one that calculated my mark margins for upcoming exams to allow me to still graduate with first class honours.\nFollowing graduation, I joined a small engineering firm, where I contributed to the development of control software for automated test rigs. We built custom rigs to test components like aircraft actuators and truck brake assemblies, using the visual programming language LabVIEW. This involved wiring code sections together, and I still recognise LabVIEW’s distinctive interface in various applications, including airport airbridge controls.\nUnfortunately, I lost my job around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, coinciding with a severe contraction of the job market. During the lockdown, I used the time to learn Python, which sparked a realisation that I wanted to pursue a career in data science. While I’d always enjoyed numbers, spreadsheets, problem-solving, and programming, the pandemic provided the catalyst to connect these interests.\nI enrolled in a Data Science conversion Master’s program at Loughborough University, joining the inaugural cohort of the degree. The decision to apply to the NHS was deeply personal. My father was a GP and healthcare consultant, and my then-girlfriend (now wife), was training to be a doctor. The NHS’s mission resonated with me, and I discovered the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme. I applied and was fortunate enough to be accepted.\nI began my role at the NHS just two weeks after submitting my Master’s project."

    "text": "Once you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?\nJoining the NHS was a real whirlwind, but in the best way possible! I’ve been here for three years now, starting at NHS Digital and then transitioning into NHS England after the merger. My first two years were spent on the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme, and since then, I’ve been working as a full-fledged Data Scientist.\nThat Graduate Scheme was incredible. We were the first cohort of its kind, a group of just under twenty, and we kicked things off with an intense eight-week coding bootcamp. It was a fantastic bonding experience – we’d be hammering away at code and then decompressing with board games during breaks.\nMy first placement on the NHS Spine project, which is this massive, intricate system connecting all sorts of different NHS systems. Because it’s so complex, everyone was constantly learning, and that made it a really supportive environment for a newbie like me. Plus, I got to see firsthand what a well-oiled DevOps team looked like, which really shaped my approach moving forward, especially when I landed in the Business Intelligence Development Team.\nThat team was all about building Tableau dashboards and trying to standardise things. My manager asked me to dig into the Tableau API. They had this super slow, manual process for checking dashboards, and I realised we could automate it with Python. So, I built a proof-of-concept testing framework, which was a great chance to put my NHS Spine lessons to work in a totally different area.\nMy final placement was with the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) Squad. We were all about promoting good coding practices for analytics and helping teams automate their workflows. Basically, we were bringing in the best of data and software engineering into the data science and analytics space. In that role, I got to write articles, create training guides, and even run workshops. We also did these ‘Engagements’ with other analytical teams, helping them improve their processes. After a year, I passed my end-of-scheme interview and got promoted to a Band 7 Data Scientist, staying with the RAP Squad and leading those Engagements.\nMore recently, I moved to the National Secure Data Environment Service Team, or the SDE Data Wranglers. We make sure researchers get the right, pseudonymised data. While there, I also got to work on a side project developing an ML-powered tool to detect potentially sensitive information in huge datasets. It was a fun challenge, working with Docker containers, PySpark, and figuring out how to deploy ML models in a clustered computing environment.\nOverall, it’s been a really varied and rewarding experience. Each role has built on the last, and I’ve learned so much about the NHS and the power of data."

    "text": "What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nRight now, I’m embedded within an analytical team focused on commissioning specialised NHS services. It’s a really interesting area, and I’m helping them boost their Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) compliance, automate some of their manual processes, and bring in some Python expertise to diversify their toolkit.\nOne project I’m particularly excited about is automating their monthly reporting. We’ve managed to cut the processing time from a week down to just a few minutes, which is a huge win! It’s incredibly rewarding to free up my colleagues’ time, allowing them to focus on more impactful, data-driven insights rather than repetitive tasks.\nI’m also personally driven to achieve something new for me; building a pipeline that meets Gold RAP compliance standard; essentially, a fully automated and packaged analytical process. We’re facing some interesting challenges, but I’m confident that overcoming them will pave the way for more efficient and robust projects in the future."

One of the key ideas presented was the concept of AI-driven profiles that could be created based on an individual’s opinions and values, with the potential to vote on bills and acts on their behalf. This led to a lively debate on the implications of such a system, and what type of democracy we’d like to see AI help facilitate- representative, direct or deliberative.\nThroughout the session, the group expressed a healthy dose of skepticism, particularly regarding the biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems. Concerns were raised about the potential for AI to reflect and even exacerbate existing biases, as well as the broader implications for democracy and personal agency. The discussion highlighted the complex and often controversial nature of combining AI with politics, but also the potential for innovative applications that could transform how we engage with governance.\nThe Professional Development Functional Team is excited to continue hosting these monthly Data Science Discussions. If you have a data science topic you’re passionate about and would like to share with others, please reach out to us to host a session. The format is designed to be collaborative and conversational, with most of the session taking place in breakout rooms, so all you need is a spark of inspiration to get the conversation started.\nInterested in learning a bit more about this topic?\nStay tuned for an update on what seminars & show and tells will look like in the new team.

In this article, the author shares her experiences at the event.\nLast week, the long awaited Hack for Health hosted at the beautiful Story Club, in Paddington London, by Microsoft and NHSE finally happened! At the hackathon, every team had either a Kainos or Microsoft representative, as well as a range of participants from across NHS England, including a strong Data Science Team presence, with several of our team members in each group. And unlike a usual hackathon, this one had stakeholders and well defined use cases, we were all working to one common goal.\nContinue reading…\nAs mentined in last month’s newsletter, the RPySOC conference was hosted, bringing together enthusiasts of all things R, Python and Open Source software from all over the country. In the spirit of things being open and freely available, the talks and slides have been made available to you all to watch in your own time!\nFor some, the festive period can allow a little bit of a reprieve from projects and meetings: the perfect time to do that training you always wanted to do but never had the time for. Consider blocking out some time for yourself to hit your learning goals!\nHow many tries will it take you?"

    "text": "Welcome to the latest newsletter from the Data Science Community for Health and Care, brought to you by the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team.\nThe newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.\nIf you cannot access something of interest to you, please reach out.\nThanks for reading! – newsletter team\nwritten by Jennifer Struthers\nIf you are a regular reader of this newsletter you might have seen the RPySOC event plugged each month, which was at long last held last week. The conference was a celebration of all things R/Python/Open-Source, and everyone there was excited to show off the projects they had been involved in over the last year.\nThere were at least 100 people gathered in the Birmingham International Conference Centre, and more present online where the talks were being live-streamed. People seemed to be saying hello to colleagues that they hadn’t seen in a while, and sitting down at tables to meet new people and discuss all things healthcare and coding.\nI went along to present my project on experimenting with open-source dashboarding tools and packages, which I had undertaken earlier this year to develop my data visualisation and general coding skills. It was a brief talk, with just a 15 minute timeslot, but I got surprisingly more nervous as the morning went on. I’ve given variants of this presentation before, and I was confident in answering any questions on it, really I should have been fine. However this was the first time since I was in university that I had stood in front of people and spoken to them, instead of hidden behind my computer screen talking to my slides. Strange how something like hybrid working has completely changed something as fundamental as giving a presentation.\nLuckily, my fears were unfounded. The stage lights were so bright I couldn’t see anyone anyway and I could pretend I was still at my desk, talking at my slides like normal. Before I knew it I was back at my table and could breathe and enjoy the rest of the conference, while typing away to answer all the questions and comments that had come through during my talk.\nThere was a Slack channel organised for questions which meant that online viewers had the same chance to ask questions as in-person attendees, and the speakers could take their time afterwards to answer extra questions and give links. Almost every single presentation included links to public GitHub repositories, and people were actively encouraged to check out the code, and re-use whatever they wanted to.\nThe whole conference was focused on sharing, collaborating and supporting others, regardless of where they were at in the coding journey. It was a great gathering of a community (full of provided food and coffee!), and what really struck me was how keen everyone was to get involved, give people pointers, and congratulate them on the work they had done. The talks were evenly distributed between Python and R users, and everything pitched at a level anyone with a coding interest could understand. If you’ve got a project you’re working on and are keen to share the results in front of an audience, I would definitely recommend next year’s RPySOC!\nThe conference organisers will be sharing the recordings of the talks, along with slides and links, at a later date so that the knowledge can be shared on and on.\nThe data science team at NHS England hold Data Science Discussions on a monthly (ish!) basis. These discussions are typically informal, and in a small group to encourage as much discussion as possible. The most recent Data Science Discussion was delivered by Ben Wallace, one of the senior data scientists within the team.\nBen was keen to introduce the idea of science communication and how to get your ideas across correctly. We discussed how to explain complex topics such as lossy compression in an easily understandable manor. Through examples we discussed when explanations were too complex, too simple, or just right, before having a go ourselves at explaining tricky data science terms.\nInterested in learning more about science communication? Check out these resources below:\nThere are a myriad of data science communities doing excellent work to link people, share resources and support people in their careers and personal projects: check out some of them below and get involved!\nGot a project to showcase? An event to plug? A tip to share?\nWe want to hear from you! This newsletter is a community effort and we want to showcase and spread the word about all of the good work being done across it.\nClick here, or at the bottom of the page to submit your contribution!\nHow many tries will it take you?"

Read about the challenge and her experience below.\nI was a part of one of the teams who were finalists at the civil service data challenge (CSDC) which is an annual event where teams come together to pitch innovative ideas to secure funding. Think of it like Dragon’s Den or Shark Tank but with friendlier judges who are all senior data leaders from across the public sector. A multidisciplinary team chosen from the applicants across public sector were tasked to build a product roadmap for RouteCare, an NHS geospatial tool, that can be pitched for funding. We were among the four finalists, and we came a close second place (still gutted!). While it meant we didn’t receive the funding, it was a huge achievement for the team! We were also the only all-women-panel which inspired several members of the audience who kindly congratulated us for our presentation - a highlight for me.\nNow for some behind the scenes. This was not a hackathon but an entire “side” project involving multiple stakeholders. Once we were selected after the semi-finals, each team was allocated a mentor from the judging panel and ours was John Quinn, Chief Information Officer, NHS England. This helped in securing senior management buy-in straightaway, however expanded the vision of the product. John’s involvement opened several doors for us including obtaining buy-in from Helen Balsdon, Chief Nursing Information Officer, NHS England and partnership with Google to further build this tool.\nWe however lost a few team members to churn, and I took on the leadership of the tool. This was an excellent opportunity to pick up skills including different styles of leadership (technical and motivational), influencing senior stakeholders, collaboration with team members with diverse backgrounds, commercial negotiation and most of all, public speaking (presenting to a 200-member audience whilst being filmed isn’t my idea of fun).\nI would highly recommend applying for the next cohort of CSDC if you would like an overall development opportunity which is unique and will certainly be a valuable experience for your career!\nLots of exciting things coming up!

With the popularity of LLM’s for everyday use growing, the total energy consumption is rising. Being aware of the energy consumption of your code is not only more important than ever, it is also easier than ever to do so.\nCodeCarbon is a open-source Python package designed to help you estimate the carbon footprint of computing tasks, particularly for machine learning and other high-performance computing workloads. It does this by estimating your hardware electricity power consumption (GPU + CPU + RAM) and applies the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done. More is explained about this calculation in the Methodology section of the documentation.\nAdd this (or any other tracker you know of!) to your next pipeline and start taking steps toward more sustainable computing.\n\n\n\nNHS Python Community - What is Python?\nCurious about Python in healthcare?

The session will include two talks: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow, and Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare.\nAbstract: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow\nPoor admitted non-elective patient flow is a major issue for many acute trusts. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a useful tool for modelling patient pathways. This project used DES to model patient flow for non-elective admissions. The model was used to investigate how reductions in inpatient length of stay, non-criteria to reside, additional escalation beds and fluctuations in demand impact waits for admission in ED. The model allows testing of ad hoc scenarios, via a user-friendly streamlit app, and has also been used to provide evidence-based targets for inpatient length of stay and informed discussions about relevant flow metrics. In this talk I’ll discuss the model, how it works and some of the insights from the project and happy to answer any questions or receive any suggestions you may have!\nAbstract: Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare\nThe current methods used for data linkage or indexing in the healthcare industry follow deterministic algorithms that are not transparent to the end users and with often sub-optimal outcomes. Our work focuses on building and implementing a probabilistic algorithm that improves quality as well as explainability of the linkage. In this project we have used Splink, a UK Ministry of Justice probabilistic linkage Python package, to build a pipeline that links any health data set to the Personal Demographics Service (PDS), a dataset containing information about all patients registered to a GP in England, which acts as our linkage “spine”.\nWe have added this event to our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar, where you can find the calendar invite to access the event.\nIf you would like to be invited to future events of ours, sign up to our mailing list!\n\n\nThe Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme\n\nThe Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme teaches public sector analysts, clinicians and managers how to use data science and operational research techniques, as well as supporting them to apply these techniques in their organisations.\nThe full HSMA course experience is provided free of charge to people working in health, social care and policing organisations in England.\nThe full HSMA experience is a live, 15-month programme with two distinct phases: a 6 month training phase where participants learn the Python programming language, and a 9 month project phase where participants are supported to produce their own project using the new skills they have learned.\nRecently, two NHS England Data Scientists completed the HSMA course and have written a blog post about the course and their project. Have a read of the exciting things they got up to!\nInterested in taking part in the next cohort? Sign up to their mailing list to keep up to date with their plans for next years HSMA course.

Here, we delve into the diverse career paths and impactful work of the talented individuals who make up the NHS England Data Science team. Our goal is to shine a light on the fantastic people driving the NHS Data Science Profession forward and to offer valuable perspectives for anyone considering a career in healthcare data science.\nThis week our interviewee is Mobolu Olowoyeye, a Data Scientist intern that joined the Data Science Team for eight weeks. Mobolu has a keen interest in AI ethics and has been involved in various projects that explore the intersection of technology and public good.\n\n\nRead more…\n\n\nHow did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nUsing technology to drive positive change? There’s no place I’d rather be!\nMaking a real-world impact with technology has always been a key motivation for me, so when I saw how data science could make a difference in healthcare at the NHS, I was all in!\nI’ve just finished my first year of university and decided to spend my summer exploring possible career paths. I’m currently studying Artificial Intelligence at King’s College London. Yes, AI is officially a degree now; Crazy, right?\nI’ve always loved mathematics and computer science, but I specifically chose to study AI because of its multidisciplinary nature and my passion for AI Ethics. I became intrigued by AI ethics and understanding technology’s impact on society after watching the documentary ‘Coded Bias,’ which explored algorithmic bias in facial recognition technology. As an aspiring black woman in tech, seeing the impact of bias on people who look like me opened my eyes to a worrying reality. This inspired me to create an academic research poster on the topic, which I had the wonderful opportunity to present at the House of Lords!\nMy journey into data science began the summer after my GCSEs, with a four-week internship at QBE Insurance. I discovered I really enjoyed working with big data, and the following year, I had the chance to work at Circana, a big data and analytics company. I also gained a behind-the-scenes look at how tech companies use data to make decisions during my time as a data science mentee at Deliveroo.\nI also dipped into quantitative finance, gaining software engineering experience at G-Research and spending time at PDT Partners, a quantitative investment firm. While I found these experiences incredibly interesting, I realised I’m more drawn to data science with a social or public impact—not just numbers, but outcomes that improve people’s lives.\nThat’s where the NHS came in. I’ve always been passionate about using technology as a force for good, and data science in healthcare feels like exactly that. Whether it’s tackling health inequalities, improving patient outcomes, or making systems run more efficiently, its impact is real and visible.\nAlongside this internship, I’ve been an undergraduate research fellow at King’s, focusing on the ethical implications of AI in insurance law. I was also selected as one of 200 students for a BAME mentorship programme, where I was mentored by a PhD researcher working on ethics in language models.\nSo, between the technical side, the public good aspect, and my passion for ethical, responsible tech, data science in the NHS just made sense. Long-term, I’d love to work in AI policy or as a data ethicist, helping shape how technology is used fairly and safely across society. I’m also hoping to do a placement year in industry during my third year of university.\n\n\nWhat are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nI’ve been interning with the Data Science and Applied AI team for the past eight weeks. During this time, I’ve had the opportunity to learn, lead, and contribute in ways that have truly shaped my understanding of data science and AI in healthcare.\nOne of my most insightful experiences was speaking with front-line workers. I went to Epsom Hospital to talk with GPs about AI tools like Ambient Voice Technology and ran a small focus group to explore how AI impacts their daily work.\nMy main project has been the Synthetic Clinical Notes Project, where we create synthetic patient data to train an AI model for automating discharge summaries. When I joined, the dataset primarily used White British names and ethnicities. As someone from an ethnic minority with a culturally distinctive name, I recognised the risk of bias this could create. To address this, I’ve spent the last few weeks diversifying the naming data, researching names from a wide range of ethnic groups based on NHS staff survey statistics. By helping create a more representative dataset, I’ve contributed to making the project more ethically robust and ensuring it serves the public interest. I also helped update the style instructions for the clinicians who write these notes.\nAlongside my project work, I’ve been completing the Edward Jenner Leadership Programme, spoke on AI ethics at a GOSH training session, developed my Python skills through the Federated Data Platform pipeline, and contributed to discussions around data hazard labels. These experiences have all deepened my commitment to building responsible and impactful technology.\n\n\nIf you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?\nMy biggest piece of advice to an incoming data science intern would be to be inquisitive! Don’t hesitate to ask questions or ask for clarification. Many terms, concepts or abbreviations will probably be new to you and you don’t want to be left confused or behind in meetings or on your day-to-day.\nWhilst you are here to learn and gain experience; you can also offer fresh and valuable perspectives too! Don’t be afraid to contribute and share your knowledge, opinions and ideas.\nStay open minded, don’t limit yourself to one particular career path or area of the team. Most people’s career paths aren’t linear so be open to trying new things and developing new skillsets. So, say yes to opportunities!\n“Yes” has become one of my favourite words and has definitely opened more doors for me than I could have ever imagined. That being said, it’s important to know when to say no, and what meetings or experiences aren’t beneficial to you. Say yes to opportunities but don’t overwhelm yourself - it’s all about finding balance!\nTake initiative, stay busy, ask for things to do. Strive for excellence in all you do - you want people to remember you for what you’ve done and the fact that you’ve done it well. I’d advise you to set goals for yourself to give yourself direction and so that you know what you’re working towards and have clarity on what you want to achieve before the end of your internship!\n\nWe hope you found this interview with Mobolu Olowoyeye interesting. Her journey demonstrates how a passion for ethical technology and a drive to make a positive impact is building the foundations for a meaningful career, providing an example on how to combine technical skills with a commitment to public good.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Data Scientist working in Healthcare, you can read our previous ‘Interview with a Data Scientist’ with Amaia Imaz Blanco, The Data Scientist Who Just Wanted to Make Plots, on the NHS England Data Science Website.\n\n\n\n\nJuly Analyst X Data Science Huddle\n\nRecently, the Data Science Community for Health and Care organised a talk discussing the principles used in building the NHSRwaitinglist package, a package to apply calculations and principles from queuing theory to NHS waiting list analysis.\nMissed the session? Check out the recording and PowerPoint slides here, where you will also find the recordings of previous huddles.\n\n\nAnalyst X DS Huddle: Dual Project Showcase\n\n23rd of September 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online\nThe Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for September! The session will include two talks: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow, and Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare.\nAbstract: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow\nPoor admitted non-elective patient flow is a major issue for many acute trusts. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a useful tool for modelling patient pathways. This project used DES to model patient flow for non-elective admissions. The model was used to investigate how reductions in inpatient length of stay, non-criteria to reside, additional escalation beds and fluctuations in demand impact waits for admission in ED. The model allows testing of ad hoc scenarios, via a user-friendly streamlit app, and has also been used to provide evidence-based targets for inpatient length of stay and informed discussions about relevant flow metrics. In this talk I’ll discuss the model, how it works and some of the insights from the project and happy to answer any questions or receive any suggestions you may have!\nAbstract: Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare\nThe current methods used for data linkage or indexing in the healthcare industry follow deterministic algorithms that are not transparent to the end users and with often sub-optimal outcomes. Our work focuses on building and implementing a probabilistic algorithm that improves quality as well as explainability of the linkage. In this project we have used Splink, a UK Ministry of Justice probabilistic linkage Python package, to build a pipeline that links any health data set to the Personal Demographics Service (PDS), a dataset containing information about all patients registered to a GP in England, which acts as our linkage “spine”.\nWe have added this event to our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar, where you can find the calendar invite to access the event.\nIf you would like to be invited to future events of ours, sign up to our mailing list!\n\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!
