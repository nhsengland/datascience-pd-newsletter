Read about the challenge and her experience below.\nI was a part of one of the teams who were finalists at the civil service data challenge (CSDC) which is an annual event where teams come together to pitch innovative ideas to secure funding. Think of it like Dragon’s Den or Shark Tank but with friendlier judges who are all senior data leaders from across the public sector. A multidisciplinary team chosen from the applicants across public sector were tasked to build a product roadmap for RouteCare, an NHS geospatial tool, that can be pitched for funding. We were among the four finalists, and we came a close second place (still gutted!). While it meant we didn’t receive the funding, it was a huge achievement for the team! We were also the only all-women-panel which inspired several members of the audience who kindly congratulated us for our presentation - a highlight for me.\nNow for some behind the scenes. This was not a hackathon but an entire “side” project involving multiple stakeholders. Once we were selected after the semi-finals, each team was allocated a mentor from the judging panel and ours was John Quinn, Chief Information Officer, NHS England. This helped in securing senior management buy-in straightaway, however expanded the vision of the product. John’s involvement opened several doors for us including obtaining buy-in from Helen Balsdon, Chief Nursing Information Officer, NHS England and partnership with Google to further build this tool.\nWe however lost a few team members to churn, and I took on the leadership of the tool. This was an excellent opportunity to pick up skills including different styles of leadership (technical and motivational), influencing senior stakeholders, collaboration with team members with diverse backgrounds, commercial negotiation and most of all, public speaking (presenting to a 200-member audience whilst being filmed isn’t my idea of fun).\nI would highly recommend applying for the next cohort of CSDC if you would like an overall development opportunity which is unique and will certainly be a valuable experience for your career!\nLots of exciting things coming up!

    "text": "Welcome to the latest newsletter from the Data Science Community for Health and Care, brought to you by the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team.\nThe newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.\nIf you cannot access something of interest to you, please reach out.\nThanks for reading! – newsletter team\nwritten by Jennifer Struthers\nIf you are a regular reader of this newsletter you might have seen the RPySOC event plugged each month, which was at long last held last week. The conference was a celebration of all things R/Python/Open-Source, and everyone there was excited to show off the projects they had been involved in over the last year.\nThere were at least 100 people gathered in the Birmingham International Conference Centre, and more present online where the talks were being live-streamed. People seemed to be saying hello to colleagues that they hadn’t seen in a while, and sitting down at tables to meet new people and discuss all things healthcare and coding.\nI went along to present my project on experimenting with open-source dashboarding tools and packages, which I had undertaken earlier this year to develop my data visualisation and general coding skills. It was a brief talk, with just a 15 minute timeslot, but I got surprisingly more nervous as the morning went on. I’ve given variants of this presentation before, and I was confident in answering any questions on it, really I should have been fine. However this was the first time since I was in university that I had stood in front of people and spoken to them, instead of hidden behind my computer screen talking to my slides. Strange how something like hybrid working has completely changed something as fundamental as giving a presentation.\nLuckily, my fears were unfounded. The stage lights were so bright I couldn’t see anyone anyway and I could pretend I was still at my desk, talking at my slides like normal. Before I knew it I was back at my table and could breathe and enjoy the rest of the conference, while typing away to answer all the questions and comments that had come through during my talk.\nThere was a Slack channel organised for questions which meant that online viewers had the same chance to ask questions as in-person attendees, and the speakers could take their time afterwards to answer extra questions and give links. Almost every single presentation included links to public GitHub repositories, and people were actively encouraged to check out the code, and re-use whatever they wanted to.\nThe whole conference was focused on sharing, collaborating and supporting others, regardless of where they were at in the coding journey. It was a great gathering of a community (full of provided food and coffee!), and what really struck me was how keen everyone was to get involved, give people pointers, and congratulate them on the work they had done. The talks were evenly distributed between Python and R users, and everything pitched at a level anyone with a coding interest could understand. If you’ve got a project you’re working on and are keen to share the results in front of an audience, I would definitely recommend next year’s RPySOC!\nThe conference organisers will be sharing the recordings of the talks, along with slides and links, at a later date so that the knowledge can be shared on and on.\nThe data science team at NHS England hold Data Science Discussions on a monthly (ish!) basis. These discussions are typically informal, and in a small group to encourage as much discussion as possible. The most recent Data Science Discussion was delivered by Ben Wallace, one of the senior data scientists within the team.\nBen was keen to introduce the idea of science communication and how to get your ideas across correctly. We discussed how to explain complex topics such as lossy compression in an easily understandable manor. Through examples we discussed when explanations were too complex, too simple, or just right, before having a go ourselves at explaining tricky data science terms.\nInterested in learning more about science communication? Check out these resources below:\nThere are a myriad of data science communities doing excellent work to link people, share resources and support people in their careers and personal projects: check out some of them below and get involved!\nGot a project to showcase? An event to plug? A tip to share?\nWe want to hear from you! This newsletter is a community effort and we want to showcase and spread the word about all of the good work being done across it.\nClick here, or at the bottom of the page to submit your contribution!\nHow many tries will it take you?"

    "text": "Welcome to the latest Professional Development newsletter, brought to you by the Data Science skilled team Professional Development Functional Team.\nThe newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.\nThere are some legacy NHS Digital items which we have identified with❗\nIf you cannot access something of interest to you, please reach out.\nThanks for reading! – PD newsletter team\nLots of exciting things coming up! See the full calendar here❗\nMia Noonan is a Senior Data Scientist in the NHS England Data Science team, who first joined the company as a member of the 2021 graduate cohort.\nThank you for agreeing to be the first “Interview with a Data Scientist” for the PD newsletter! I was wondering, could you tell me a bit about your background and what motivated you to pursue a career in data science in the NHS?\nM: I did economics and politics at Uni, but after a year in finance thought this isn’t for me as I didn’t really gel with the sort of work that I was doing at the time. In contrast, I found myself really interested by the work that the IT department was doing because I could see the impact that it had on my day-to-day. For example, there was one task where I had to process a load of invoices and that would take me all afternoon and then one day they just went, “Oh yeah, we’ve automated that” and I was like “what?!” – and immediately wanted to be on the side which was doing that!\nSo that was one of my main motivations to go into computer science, and I decided to do a computer science Master’s at Bath. It was quite an intense year, but it gave me the upskilling that I needed to go into more technical roles. I got introduced to data science right at the end of that year from my final research project. It was an NLP project where I had to analyse the transcription of everything that’s said in parliament, to understand where MPs are focusing their attention. I really enjoyed it because it was a bridge between economics, politics and computer science.\nOnce I did that project I thought, yeah, this is this is super cool, this is exactly where I want to be. Someone I was speaking to mentioned that there was a data science team in the NHS and I was like wow, I didn’t know - but immediately wanted to be a part of it! I was lucky enough to get a placement in the data science team through the NHS Digital graduate scheme, and the rest is history…!\nWhat specific professional development tools or resources did you find most helpful in skilling up on your time of the graduate scheme?\nM: I had Kin as a line manager, so that was great. He was very, very good at articulating SMART goals, and I think that really helped because the goals were so well laid out, a lot of the competencies I could just tick off on the job due to the variety of work in the data linkage enhancement team. I was lucky with my placement, my line manager, and had a lot of the things I could just do on the job, which was great.\nIn terms of technical skills, Pluralsight would be my bread and butter in terms of a tool and a resource to turn to just to upskill. If I’m like “oh, I don’t know what an S3 bucket is, I need to do some AWS training”, if there’s a specific technical skill I need to learn, I’d go to that.\nI think I find that I probably sometimes upskill a little bit easier when I’m doing something on the job and practically applying it straight away. I really try and actively seek out the opportunities to go and upskill in other areas. I try not to be passive about my development goals and seek out the opportunities, and if there’s something that interests me, follow up on it.\nWhat keeps you motivated and passionate about your work and data science with the NHS?\nM: It’s really exciting just being able to continuously learn new things and be on the forefront of new disruptive technologies. I like the fact that the work we’re doing is making a real difference to the NHS, it’s great.\nBeing surrounded by such great team members also makes a big difference. The team has got so much knowledge inside of it that it’s easy to organically learn things from people. It’s a positive learning environment and has a culture of safety and openness, there’s no one in the team I would feel hesitant going to ask a question to.\nAnd then also having that culture of wanting everyone to do well, makes you want to do well because you want to contribute back and create that positive cycle for the whole team and feel like you’re contributing towards that.\nThe current graduates will be embarking on their End of Scheme in the next fortnight or so. What is a piece of advice that you have for them?\nM: In terms of something that’s relevant to this point in terms of their career and passing their End of Scheme I would say that my biggest piece of advice would be don’t stop being curious about things. They’ve had a really intense upskilling period where they’ve gone through two years of intense rotations, being exposed to those different areas, but don’t stop that momentum just because you’ve rolled off the scheme. Go out, speak to loads of different teams, different people, keep networking. Keep trying different projects, different things because you’ll learn more and more about what interests and motivates you, because two years sounds like a long time, but it’s really short.\nThis interview was edited for brevity\nHow many tries will it take you?"

The team had various talks, posters and workshops delivered at the conference about our work and projects. Warren Davies reports back.\n\n\n\nNHS England RAP Star Warren Davies giving a talk at HACA on RAP Principles\n\n\nAt the HACA conference 2024 I gave a talk on RAP to a huge crowd, over 4,000 people, great people, the best people. OK more like 70. And I also helped run workshops on Python and RAP. I highly recommend the experience overall. I gained the following XP:\n\n+10 Planning – it’s tricky to plan when you don’t know in advance the size and experience of the audience (in the workshops we opted to give a flavour of what was possible, along with some simple exercises people could follow along with).\n+10 Schmoozing – it is actually very easy. People are very happy to talk about their work and how you might be able to help them.\n+20 Resilience – public speaking can be nerve wracking but that is OK, it’s just weakness leaving the body.\n\nBut you also have the opportunity to help other people. It’s easy to take for granted in NHS England that we basically have a huge bunch of geniuses at our beck and call that that we can pester and learn from every day. But not every analyst in the wider NHS and health world is so lucky. Within trusts and regional organisations, there are often small teams - or even individuals - who do similar work to us but don’t have the kind of support we do.\nWith events like HACA we have the chance to connect with them, and point them to resources and communities they might not know about. Which not only helps them, but gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside too (incidentally, it also ticks a whole load of those “Sharing knowledge” boxes on the competency framework…).\nYou should definitely go next time. You will build your networking skills, help people out, and get loads of great examples you can use when you apply for that promotion. Plus, everyone loves a road trip right?\n\nSchool Placement\n\nIn July, the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team hosted a school placement, hosting five students from a London based secondary school to teach them about our work and show them some of the skills they would need to start a career in data science. Liz Kelly describes her experience, working to prepare this week to show the school pupils what our team does, and give them a taste of how it might be to work with us.\n\n\n\nSome really happy cartoon kids on a school placement, ready to learn about the NHS England Data Science team.\n\n\nThis was a rewarding yet difficult task, involving a lot of admin, paperwork, and even a conversation with NHS England lawyers to check we were dotting all our i’s and crossing all our t’s. Naturally, after all this, there were still the dreaded tech setup issues (sigh). But Chaeyoon did an amazing job at fixing them in record time, so the students could still get the most out of their placement.\nAs a graduate in the Data Science team, I know first-hand how valuable it is for colleagues to take time to explain the various cogs in the NHS system. Because let’s be honest, it’s a bit complicated. So, we made sure to cover as many areas as possible to help with this understanding.\nAbout half of the data scientists (a total of 22) met students during the placement week, alongside more indirect engagements from others such as helping with the training materials. The students rotated through four data science teams and were introduced to two methods of data science ways of working: python programming and collaborative works on GitHub. At the end of the placement week, they had a mock interview and an optional task to build a classifier function with if-else conditions to find which group (from the placement sessions) they could match to the session information. It is incredible to think some of the students had never touched programming before and yet, by the end of the week, they had a basic understanding of Python!\nI personally enjoyed the challenge of organising the timetable for the students and leading them through workshops and career talks. Who doesn’t love a good to-do list! And since I don’t cover this kind of outreach in my day-to-day role, this was an excellent opportunity. I could tick off those leadership and mentoring competencies, not to mention dealing with complexity (those pesky access and tech issues). I will admit, teaching a group over Teams is trickier than I thought, especially interactive sessions. The students were eager to discuss and answer questions but sometimes their meeting room microphone didn’t quite catch what they were saying … or perhaps it was just me and the London accent.\nAs this was the first of its kind, it took a while to discover all the rules and policies. Now we have done this once, subsequent placements should be a lot easier to host. We have collated the resources used here, currently accessible to those in NHSE DS GitHub team. We are working to collate and publish our resources more widely in the future.\nAs soon as we say “I work for the NHS”, peoples first thoughts are frontline staff, not data scientists. It wasn’t until I was graduating university that I stumbled across data science roles in the NHS and even then, it was purely accidental. When I think back to my time at school I would have loved to do this work experience week in the NHS.\nI know I am not alone when I say just how important it is to introduce young people to Data Science, particularly in the NHS. This provides them with more avenues to follow and more ideas of what is out there. It makes the world of possibilities just that bit bigger.\nOnce again, thank you to everyone involved. I’m sure you’ll agree the placement week was a success, just perhaps short of a few tea and biscuit breaks. The students are not used to being at a desk all day!\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

There is more than one way to leverage this recent breakthrough. You can create a chatbot by directly “plugging” to a LLM and start asking questions. However, LLMs are limited to the information available in the data they have seen during their training. So how to build a chatbot that will be able to answer questions related to documents that the model has never seen. One solution is to use a technique called “Retrieval Augmented Generation” (RAG). After an introduction of Generative AI and transformers, we will go through the RAG logic and explore its benefits and potential drawbacks. The talk is intended for anyone interested in generative AI and its potential applications.\n\n\nTranslational Science Methods Club: Explainable AI\nTuesday 20th Aug 2024, 15:30 - 17:00, Virtual Seminar\nThe theme of this T-SciM event will be explainable AI (XAI). This refers to a range of approaches that seek to design or evaluate ways to make the outputs of artificial intelligence algorithms more interpretable. Such explainability is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying the models computations and determine how trustworthy and generalisable their results are.\nWe will be joined by 3 speakers, who will give short talks introducing their work on XAI, followed by a panel discussion with questions and prompts from the audience.\nSpeakers include: Dr Ahmed Salih, Dr Tapabrata (Rohan) Chakraborty and Sophie Martin (ex-PhD intern with the NHSE DS team).\n\n\nHealth Data Science Seminar Series: Transforming Healthcare: AI in Health Data Science\nThursday 12th September 2024, 14:00 - 15:30, Teams\nThis series of seminars presents an exciting opportunity to hear about recent developments in health data science, generate ideas and help build the health data science community. It is hosted by the ONS’s Data Science Campus and Health Analysis Team in partnership with Health Data Research UK (HDR UK).\nThe Health Data Science Seminar series provides a dedicated space for data scientists, policymakers, health professionals, academics, epidemiologists, statisticians and other members of the data science community to come together and explore the potential of data science, to help improve health and health policy.\nThis event will feature presentations from guest speakers including:\nDr Siegfried Karl Wagner - Ophthalmologist and senior research fellow, University College London Professor Christopher Yau - Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Turing AI Fellow, University of Oxford\n\n\nData Science Festival: Oktoberfest\nSaturday 19th October 2024, 9am-5pm, CodeNode London\nApply for a FREE ballot entry to this years DSF Oktoberfest.

With the popularity of LLM’s for everyday use growing, the total energy consumption is rising. Being aware of the energy consumption of your code is not only more important than ever, it is also easier than ever to do so.\nCodeCarbon is a open-source Python package designed to help you estimate the carbon footprint of computing tasks, particularly for machine learning and other high-performance computing workloads. It does this by estimating your hardware electricity power consumption (GPU + CPU + RAM) and applies the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done. More is explained about this calculation in the Methodology section of the documentation.\nAdd this (or any other tracker you know of!) to your next pipeline and start taking steps toward more sustainable computing.\n\n\n\nNHS Python Community - What is Python?\nCurious about Python in healthcare?

These discussions aren’t recorded, we want to make everyone feel as comfortable as possible to discuss their thoughts and ideas on whatever topic we are talking about.\nMost recently our discussion focussed on professional development in our current roles, and how we can support others to take advantage of the opportunities they have.\nOne discussion point that came up in a few groups was the difference between purposeful development time versus just doing the job and where the line is drawn between them. It was felt that a lot of the work we do involves researching and learning about different techniques and methods, and that this could really also be considered professional development.\nA theme that also came up across groups was the lack of time available for dedicated professional development for topics and areas that are separate from the day to day work. A lot of people felt like they had limited time for self-directed study, and that getting the job done took priority which led to professional development taking a back seat. In order to mitigate this, people suggested blocking out calendar time in advance in order to pre-book learning time, although sticking to this can be hard if you’re busy.\nWe had members from various NHS teams present at this discussion and there was also a definite split, with some teams feeling like they were allowed a lot more time and were encouraged to take development opportunities more than others. This highlighted a bit of a difference in team culture, and there was discussion about how those who are allotted more time could support those without.\nThe most engaging discussion point? Whether a hot dog is a sandwich. We’re still split on it.\nWant to get the calendar invite for the next one? Sign up to our mailing list.\nWant to host a Discussion?

    "text": "Welcome to the latest Professional Development newsletter, brought to you by the Data Science skilled team Professional Development Functional Team.\nThe newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.\nThere are some legacy NHS Digital items which we have identified with❗\nIf you cannot access something of interest to you, please reach out.\nThanks for reading! – PD newsletter team\nLots of exciting things coming up! See the full calendar here❗, and a small selection below.\nRecently, we held another Data Science Discussion, where we encourage people to look into a different area or use case of data science than they might strictly look at in their day job and spark discussion on a peer-to-peer level.\nThis time we delved into the intriguing topic of data science and democracy, hosted by Mia Noonan.\nMia kicked off the discussion by asking the group to consider the different ways data science could interact with and potentially reshape the political landscape. One of the key ideas presented was the concept of AI-driven profiles that could be created based on an individual’s opinions and values, with the potential to vote on bills and acts on their behalf. This led to a lively debate on the implications of such a system, and what type of democracy we’d like to see AI help facilitate- representative, direct or deliberative.\nThroughout the session, the group expressed a healthy dose of skepticism, particularly regarding the biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems. Concerns were raised about the potential for AI to reflect and even exacerbate existing biases, as well as the broader implications for democracy and personal agency. The discussion highlighted the complex and often controversial nature of combining AI with politics, but also the potential for innovative applications that could transform how we engage with governance.\nThe Professional Development Functional Team is excited to continue hosting these monthly Data Science Discussions. If you have a data science topic you’re passionate about and would like to share with others, please reach out to us to host a session. The format is designed to be collaborative and conversational, with most of the session taking place in breakout rooms, so all you need is a spark of inspiration to get the conversation started.\nInterested in learning a bit more about this topic?\nStay tuned for an update on what seminars & show and tells will look like in the new team. Please bear with us as it is likely to be a learning process! Contact Mia Noonan for more information.\nHow many tries will it take you?"

    "text": "HACA 2024: Relive the experience\nCouldn’t make the event in person? Had to pick between two presentations on at the same time? No worries - the Health and Care Analytics conference hosted in July recorded all their presentations and has now uploaded them onto their YouTube channel, and can be easily accessed from their site.\nHACA was also full of amazing posters on a wide range of topics, so many it was hard to read them all! You can check out the posters on their site as well."

    "text": "Large Language Model Tutorial\nCurious about how you could create your own LLM but worried it’ll be too complicated or costly? Adam and Sam Hollings have put together an LLM tutorial to walk you through some simple implementations. The software is all free and runs inside Google Collab, so it won’t cost you anything. Some ability with python will be helpful, and an interest in data science and LLMs will help!\nInstructions for set up, or for contacting the owners can be found in this GitHub repository."
