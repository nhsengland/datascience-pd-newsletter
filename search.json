    "text": "Welcome to the latest newsletter from the Data Science Community for Health and Care, brought to you by the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team.\nThe newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.\nIf you cannot access something of interest to you, please reach out.\nThanks for reading! – newsletter team\n\nInterview with a Data Scientist - The Data Scientist Who Just Wanted to Make Plots\n\nWelcome to another insightful installment of our “Interview with a Data Scientist” series. Here, we delve into the diverse career paths and impactful work of the talented individuals who make up the NHS England Data Science team. Our goal is to shine a light on the fantastic people driving the NHS Data Science Profession forward and to offer valuable perspectives for anyone considering a career in healthcare data science.\nThis week our interviewee is Amaia Imaz Blanco, a Data Scientist in the Data Science Team whose love of making graphs led her to the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme and eventually into probabilistic data linkage!\n\n\nRead more…\n\n\nHow did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nI wouldn’t say I had a grand plan to get into data science — but looking back, it probably isn’t a huge surprise. When I was asked what I wanted to be at age 11, I said “a maths teacher,” which felt a bit out of step with the dreams of astronauts and footballers around me. That early love for numbers truly set the stage for my academic and professional life.\nFast forward to being 16, and I stumbled upon the existence of an Astrophysics degree. From that moment, that became the goal. I’ve always loved to describe astrophysics as “just maths with pretty pictures,” and honestly, what’s not to love about that combination? In 2018, fresh out of school, I embarked on a Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology MPhys at Lancaster University. My Masters project involved a deep dive into a dataset of 40,000 galaxies, performing extensive classification and statistical analysis. However, my very first taste of what I now recognise as data science techniques came during an internship at The University of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy. There, I used Markov-Chain Monte Carlo modelling to understand the shapes and densities of debris and dust around exoplanets, which even led to this published paper.\nNearing the end of my university studies, a significant realisation dawned on me: despite my enthusiasm for my degree and for astrophysics as a whole, I just wanted to contribute to something that had a tangible impact in the “real world.” So, I dove into the job market, applying to almost every role that claimed to welcome physics graduates, though with limited success. It was during a moment of frustration that my mum suggested: “Amaia, you love understanding complicated topics through reading and making graphs, why don’t you look for jobs where you can do that?”\nThat simple question was a revelation. It completely shifted my perspective, and I began searching for data-focused roles. That’s how I discovered the NHS Digital graduate scheme. It felt like the perfect alignment – an opportunity to explore a data career within a broader technical scheme, which meant I wasn’t locked into a single path. Crucially, it offered the chance to make a real difference for real people, within an organisation I deeply believe in.\n\n\nOnce you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?\nI’ve now been with the NHS for nearly three years, beginning my journey at NHS Digital before its merger with NHS England. Over half of this time has been dedicated to data science roles. My initial placement at NHS Digital was within an analytics team in the Secondary Care area, where I primarily worked with Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) data.\nFor my second placement, I decided to venture into something completely different, joining the Run & Maintain team in the NHS App as a software developer. It quickly became clear that this wasn’t my forte; I wasn’t very good at it, nor did I truly enjoy it. After spending a year at the NHS, observing my fellow grad, Will, creating “cool plots” for the CVD Pathways project, I decided that the team that he was in might be a good match. For my final placement, I decided to join the Data Science Team myself. I’ve since successfully graduated from the grad scheme and am now a permanent member of the Data Science and Applied AI Team.\n\n\nWhat are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nCurrently, I’m deeply involved with the Data Linkage Hub, specifically focusing on the probabilistic data linkage pipeline. This project utilises a probabilistic model designed to accurately identify records belonging to the same patient, using their demographic information. The reason this project excites me so much is its foundational importance to almost all data work within our organisation. We handle immense volumes of data, and without the ability to reliably link records to individual patients, combining datasets to understand patient pathways would be fundamentally impossible. Accurate data linkage underpins the precision of our publications, the robustness of research studies, and ultimately, the efficacy of direct patient care. This is why I’ve been dedicated to this project since joining the team, and why I continue to be enthusiastic about its impact.\nI also lead our Marketing & Comms function team, where we focus on making sure people know about the work we’re doing, the impact it’s having, and the wide range of skills across the team. It’s a part of the role I really enjoy: I get to shout about work I genuinely believe in. You can get a flavour of it from the data science website I help run here.\n\n\nIf you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?\nI believe that, more so now than even a couple of years ago when I started, there’s a strong temptation for people to apply AI and machine learning to every single problem. And as ironic as it might sound coming from someone whose job revolves around developing these products, one of the most invaluable skills I’ve got is the ability to critically assess a situation and determine when data science techniques are, in fact, not the optimal solution. Being able to think critically about the ethical implications and the practical usefulness – or lack thereof – of these products, in my opinion, makes me a more valuable team member and a more effective data scientist. Therefore, I would always advise anyone starting out to not just read about the benefits of certain techniques, but to dedicate significant time to understanding their pitfalls and limitations first.\nMy second piece of advice is that genuine enthusiasm and enjoyment in your work are the most powerful ways to succeed. Don’t pursue data science simply because it’s a popular or trendy field with growing job opportunities. Instead, figure out what truly brings you joy, be it coding, maths, creating visualisations, or anything else, and then explore how that passion aligns with the role of a data scientist. By doing so, you’ll naturally gravitate towards a niche within the vast landscape of data science, which in turn will make you a more attractive and unique candidate in the job market.\n\nWe hope you found this interview with Amaia Imaz Blanco inspiring. Her journey shows how following your enthusiasm and passions can lead you to doing work you love. You can also view our previous ‘Interview with a Data Scientist’ with Adam Hollings, Dim Sum and Data Science, on the NHS England Data Science Website.\n\n\n\n\nAnalyst X Data Science Huddles reborn!\n\nRecently, the Data Science Community for Health and Care organised a talk on exploring associations in survey data with machine learning and tidymodels. The talk compared using two different machine learning algorithms to explore the results of the General Practice Patient Survey, a national publicly-available dataset.\nMissed the session? Check out the recording and PowerPoint slides here, where you will also find the recordings of previous huddles.\n\n\nAnalyst X DS Huddle: Building the NHSRwaitinglist package\n\n22nd of July 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online\nThe Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for July! The talk will cover building the NHSRwaitinglist package. Have a read of the abstract below:\nBuilding R packages, or Python libraries, is a great way to share and disseminate your code. The process forces you to think about ‘productionising’ your code, the reproducibility of element, efficiency and the documentation of your code. Interaction with users of a package helps to identify issues, and open coding can encourage communities to fix these issues. This talk will share some of the principles of package building in R, including building functions, documenting functions, unit testing, use of GitHub and releasing a package to CRAN, the most well-known package repository. We will discuss the principles used in building the NHSRwaiting list package, a package to apply calculations and principles from queuing theory to NHS waiting list analysis. This package allows the calculation of target waiting times, understanding queue load, relief capacity required to meet target waiting times, and simple simulation of queues.\nWe have added this event to our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar, where you can find the calendar invite to access the event.\nIf you would like to be invited to future events of ours, sign up to our mailing list!\n\n\nLooking for an interesting read?\n\nThe Nature Journal has a paper on A framework to assess clinical safety and hallucination rates of LLMs for medical text summarisation.\nThe paper looks at how the fidelity between LLM outputs and ground truth information is vital to prevent miscommunication that could lead to compromise in patient safety, and proposes a framework to assess and evaluate these errors.\n\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

See the full calendar here❗\nMia Noonan is a Senior Data Scientist in the NHS England Data Science team, who first joined the company as a member of the 2021 graduate cohort.\nThank you for agreeing to be the first “Interview with a Data Scientist” for the PD newsletter! I was wondering, could you tell me a bit about your background and what motivated you to pursue a career in data science in the NHS?\nM: I did economics and politics at Uni, but after a year in finance thought this isn’t for me as I didn’t really gel with the sort of work that I was doing at the time. In contrast, I found myself really interested by the work that the IT department was doing because I could see the impact that it had on my day-to-day. For example, there was one task where I had to process a load of invoices and that would take me all afternoon and then one day they just went, “Oh yeah, we’ve automated that” and I was like “what?!” – and immediately wanted to be on the side which was doing that!\nSo that was one of my main motivations to go into computer science, and I decided to do a computer science Master’s at Bath. It was quite an intense year, but it gave me the upskilling that I needed to go into more technical roles. I got introduced to data science right at the end of that year from my final research project. It was an NLP project where I had to analyse the transcription of everything that’s said in parliament, to understand where MPs are focusing their attention. I really enjoyed it because it was a bridge between economics, politics and computer science.\nOnce I did that project I thought, yeah, this is this is super cool, this is exactly where I want to be. Someone I was speaking to mentioned that there was a data science team in the NHS and I was like wow, I didn’t know - but immediately wanted to be a part of it! I was lucky enough to get a placement in the data science team through the NHS Digital graduate scheme, and the rest is history…!\nWhat specific professional development tools or resources did you find most helpful in skilling up on your time of the graduate scheme?\nM: I had Kin as a line manager, so that was great. He was very, very good at articulating SMART goals, and I think that really helped because the goals were so well laid out, a lot of the competencies I could just tick off on the job due to the variety of work in the data linkage enhancement team. I was lucky with my placement, my line manager, and had a lot of the things I could just do on the job, which was great.\nIn terms of technical skills, Pluralsight would be my bread and butter in terms of a tool and a resource to turn to just to upskill. If I’m like “oh, I don’t know what an S3 bucket is, I need to do some AWS training”, if there’s a specific technical skill I need to learn, I’d go to that.\nI think I find that I probably sometimes upskill a little bit easier when I’m doing something on the job and practically applying it straight away. I really try and actively seek out the opportunities to go and upskill in other areas. I try not to be passive about my development goals and seek out the opportunities, and if there’s something that interests me, follow up on it.\nWhat keeps you motivated and passionate about your work and data science with the NHS?\nM: It’s really exciting just being able to continuously learn new things and be on the forefront of new disruptive technologies. I like the fact that the work we’re doing is making a real difference to the NHS, it’s great.\nBeing surrounded by such great team members also makes a big difference. The team has got so much knowledge inside of it that it’s easy to organically learn things from people. It’s a positive learning environment and has a culture of safety and openness, there’s no one in the team I would feel hesitant going to ask a question to.\nAnd then also having that culture of wanting everyone to do well, makes you want to do well because you want to contribute back and create that positive cycle for the whole team and feel like you’re contributing towards that.\nThe current graduates will be embarking on their End of Scheme in the next fortnight or so. What is a piece of advice that you have for them?\nM: In terms of something that’s relevant to this point in terms of their career and passing their End of Scheme I would say that my biggest piece of advice would be don’t stop being curious about things. They’ve had a really intense upskilling period where they’ve gone through two years of intense rotations, being exposed to those different areas, but don’t stop that momentum just because you’ve rolled off the scheme. Go out, speak to loads of different teams, different people, keep networking. Keep trying different projects, different things because you’ll learn more and more about what interests and motivates you, because two years sounds like a long time, but it’s really short.\nThis interview was edited for brevity\nHow many tries will it take you?"

This leads to children being exposed to inappropriate or harmful content and risks potential negative impacts on children’s wellbeing.\nYet the research also demonstrates that children are excited about the ways generative AI could be used to support them in their learning and for play, if developed and deployed responsibly.\nOver the course of the “Understanding the impacts of generative AI use on children” project, The Alan Turing Institute’s Children and AI team and AI for Public Services team have explored the perspectives of children, parents, carers and teachers on generative AI technologies. Their research was guided by the framework for children’s online well-being established by the UNICEF project ‘Responsible Innovation in Technology for Children’.\nThis webinar will share the key findings of the project’s two work packages namely, surveys with children, parents, carers and teachers, and school-based engagements undertaken in collaboration with Children’s Parliament.

    "text": "Welcome to the latest newsletter from the Data Science Community for Health and Care, brought to you by the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team.\nThe newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.\nIf you cannot access something of interest to you, please reach out.\nThanks for reading! – newsletter team\n\nInterview with a Data Scientist - Hopping into Data Science\n\nWelcome to another instalment of our “Interview with a Data Scientist” series, where we explore the careers and work of the talented data scientists across our healthcare organisations. We aim to showcase the fantastic individuals who contribute to Data Science within the healthcare sector and provide valuable insights for those considering a career in this field.\nThis week our interviewee is Sean Aller, a Principal Data Scientist at NHS England. Sean has a diverse background, having transitioned from academia and teaching into healthcare data science, bringing a wealth of experience and a unique perspective to his role. He is about to move on from NHS England to take up a new challenge as a Technical Specialist - Digital Intelligence Exploitation at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\n\nRead more…\n\n\nHow did you end up in data science in your healthcare organisation? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nI actually didn’t pick data science originally. My background started with an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Science at Warwick, followed by a PhD in Systems Biology. My PhD focused on the mathematical modelling of host-virus metabolic interactions; essentially trying to figure out if there is a pandemic, can we find a drug for it by looking at how the virus uses the host’s metabolism? That was where I really got my computer programming background, starting around 2018.\nFrom there, my career path was a series of hops.\nHop 1: I did a post-doc at St George’s Hospital. That was my first experience working in a healthcare setting, tackling lots of random projects over two years. Ultimately, I realised I didn’t really vibe with the academic route.\nHop 2: I moved into teaching at Decoded. I spent about a year and a half teaching a Level 5 data analytics scheme, which really solidified my technical communication skills.\nHop 3: I joined HealthHero, a digital clinic, in a data analyst role. I really enjoyed the actual work there, but the setting wasn’t quite right for me.\nFinal Hop: That led me to NHS Digital (which later merged with NHS England) as a Data Scientist. It turned out to be the perfect mix of technical work and being back in a public healthcare environment.\n\n\nOnce you joined your healthcare organisation, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?\nIt has been amazing. I sit within the Data Science team and was promoted to Principal Data Scientist during my time here. I have also had the opportunity to do stints with other teams, such as the National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) and Analytical Insights. This allowed me to do data science in a more applied setting, embedded within multidisciplinary teams.\nSome of my biggest projects involved clinical and policy work, collaborating directly with clinicians, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and academics. Through this, I gained a lot of great soft skills. A prime example was moving from the COVID IDSM work into the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Prevent projects (in its DAE, Analytical, UDAL forms). It was effectively half data science work and half working with experts to figure out how things actually function in the real world.\nThe core of the experience has been taking what the experts know and translating that into a hard data science solution. It is vital to make sure we get that right; working closely with experts is the only way to build something that is genuinely useful.\n\n\nWhat are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nOne of the most exciting things I am working on is actually the Neurodiversity Staff Network. This has been a massive opportunity to advocate and make a difference within the organisation for neurodivergent people. I helped found the Neurodiversity Support Network with a few colleagues, and it eventually became an official staff network during the merger with NHS England.\nI have been able to bring that advocacy back into the Data Science team via the Wellbeing team. We are constantly asking ourselves if we are doing things as a team that ensure we are being inclusive. We discuss these topics at away days, and it has led to practical changes like the creation of wellbeing passports.\nThis has been an area of work that was completely unexpected when I joined as a Data Scientist, but it has allowed for growth in soft skills that have been valuable in every aspect of my work.\n\n\nLooking back on your time in your healthcare organisations Data Science team, what were the most impactful moments? How do you reflect on that experience now?\nFrom a project perspective, the most impactful moment was working on the first version of the CVD project. That has now turned into a Business As Usual (BAU) product used by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) in the DHSC as part of their monitoring and the CVD prevent ecosystem. It is incredibly rewarding to have a deployed product out there just running and adding value.\nOn a cultural level, the work on inclusivity has been a highlight. Getting permission to help shape the team to be more inclusive, and having senior NHSE leadership sponsor the Neurodiversity Staff Network, made it go much further than we ever hoped. I feel like I am going to leave a contribution that helps make NHS England a better place for people to work at and be served by.\nReflecting on the experience, I found the HSMA course to be a great learning opportunity. Separately, I made a conscious effort to network with people across the organisation. Being able to learn from people in areas I didn’t even know existed and ask them “what are your pain points around data?” was invaluable. Within the Data Science team itself, I have been able to lead on points of culture. We have a flat structure in terms of cultural leadership that doesn’t value the contributions of higher paid people more, but rather values those who want to make the team a better place to work.\n\n\nIf you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?\nMy main piece of advice is: don’t get hung up on mistakes or looking like you know what you are doing.\nAsk for help and accept that you are going to make mistakes; you will save time and learn more that way. Imposter Syndrome can sometimes just mean you are working outside your comfort zone and developing more as a person.\nIf you are looking to learn a new area or skill, go find a team or project in that area and learn from them and the resources they might have created.\nIn terms of resources, I highly recommend:\n\nThe Neurodiversity Network on NHS Futures: A supportive community for neurodivergent staff and allies across the NHS, offering resources, discussion forums, and networking opportunities to promote understanding and inclusivity in the workplace.\nThe Python Graph Gallery: A comprehensive collection of data visualisation examples with Python code, covering everything from basic charts to advanced statistical graphics. Perfect for finding inspiration and learning how to implement different chart types using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.\n\nThe HSMA Course: The Health Service Modelling Associates programme offers free training in operational research, data science, and simulation modelling specifically for healthcare. Their extensive back catalogue of projects, open-source code repositories, and textbooks provides invaluable resources for understanding how to apply analytical techniques to real-world health and care challenges.\nNHS-R Community & NHS Python Community (merging to become NHS Open Analytics): Two vital open communities of practice that champion the use of R and Python in the NHS and wider health and care sector. They offer training, conferences, blogs, Slack channels, and collaborative projects to help analysts and data scientists develop their technical skills and share best practice. The communities are currently merging to form NHS Open Analytics (NHS OA), which will unite these communities under one umbrella.\nThe RAP Community of Practice: The go-to resource for learning Reproducible Analytical Pipelines. RAP is a set of principles and techniques using open-source tools to make analytical work more efficient, transparent, and less error-prone. The site offers comprehensive guidance, training materials for Git, Python, R, and PySpark, plus the NHS England Data Science team provides hands-on support to teams implementing RAP.\n\n\nWe hope you found this interview with Sean Aller insightful.\nHis journey from academia through teaching to healthcare data science demonstrates the value of embracing new challenges and the unexpected opportunities that arise along the way. Sean’s contributions to both technical projects like CVD Prevent and cultural initiatives like the Neurodiversity Staff Network show how data scientists can make a lasting impact beyond their analytical work.\nWe wish Sean all the best in his new role at the Financial Conduct Authority and look forward to seeing how he continues to drive positive change through data science.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Data Scientists working in Healthcare, you can read our previous iterations of the ‘Interview with a Data Scientist’ on the NHS England Data Science Website.\n\n\n\n\nNovember Analyst X Data Science Huddle\n\nLast week we had our November Analyst X Data Science Huddle!\nRoss Taylor presented his work on using geospatial analysis to optimise diagnostic capacity across the NHS South West region.\nThis project mapped site competition and how easily people across the Southwest can reach key diagnostics; CT, MRI and Endoscopy to ensure new capacity goes where it helps most. This supports the rollout of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDC) by showing who benefits from the Phase 1 CDC placements and identifying future sites for Phases 2 and 3.\nMissed the session? Check out the recording and PowerPoint slides here, where you will also find the recordings of previous huddles.\n\n\nDecember Analyst X Data Science Huddle\n\nTuesday 16th December 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online\nThe Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for December! The session will cover:\n\nUnlocking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science Region - presented by Oracle\n\nJoin Oracle Data Science Leaders, for an in-depth exploration of how the NHS AnalystX community can leverage Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science - a robust collaborative platform designed to accelerate analytics and machine learning capabilities for healthcare organisations.

ML methods provide fast predictions at lower computational cost than analytical or classical numerical approaches, capture nonlinear correlations in data, and adapt to changes in machine conditions. These capabilities enable robust online detection, prediction, optimisation, and control, while also supporting accelerator design by reducing the cost of numerical simulations and guiding parameter searches in high-dimensional spaces. Among ML applications, optimisation is particularly prominent, with Bayesian optimisation and reinforcement learning emerging as leading paradigms.\nIn this seminar, Dr Andrea Santamaria Garcia will focus on tuning and control tasks in particle accelerators using these methods and demonstrate their performance in real machines.\n\n\nAI, Engineering Biology and Beyond 2026\nThursday 15th January - Friday 16th January, 09:00 - 17:00, University of Bristol\nWe’re living through a revolution with AI and Engineering Biology colliding to unlock capabilities that seemed impossible just years ago.

    "text": "How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nI studied chemistry at the University of Leeds; after my undergraduate degree, I stayed on to pursue a PhD in organic chemistry.\nMy research focused on peptides and proteins, which meant a significant amount of time in the lab, and more time than I’d like to recall spent washing glassware! However, a turning point came when the department acquired a robot to run experiments. This was my first real immersion in programming and data handling.\nTowards the end of my PhD, I came across a job advertisement for the Government Operational Research Service (GORS), a service often considered a precursor to modern data science. I applied and was placed within the Department of Health.\nI’ve remained within the health sector and the realm of data ever since, for about 17 years now, although I’ve had the opportunity to work in many different areas.\nMy passion for data science truly ignited around 2016, and I took the initiative to establish a small data science team within the Department of Health. Since then, I’ve held a variety of roles across the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), NHS England, and NHSX. I also spent some valuable time at Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust and in a data policy role. Ultimately, though, leading a data science team is where my true passion lies."

    "text": "What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nAs Deputy Director of the Data Science team at NHS England, my focus has shifted from direct project involvement to leading the team and shaping its strategic direction. While I miss the day-to-day project work, I now dedicate my time to raising the team’s profile and securing new opportunities for us to contribute.\nTwo current areas of work particularly excite me. Firstly, the ongoing development of data science as a recognised profession within the NHS.\nFor example, our PhD intern programme, which connects the NHS with early-career researchers in academia, has been running successfully for several years (more information can be found here). This initiative brings fresh perspectives and skills into the NHS.\nWe also now oversee a Data Science Masters programme, a fantastic opportunity to provide advanced training to our colleagues, enhancing their capabilities and the overall data science capacity within the NHS.\nI was also involved in developing the data science competency frameworks and, more recently, a continuous professional development policy. I firmly believe that having a clear, fair, well-defined, and well-promoted profession is crucial for attracting and retaining talent and ensuring high standards.\nMore recently, I’ve had the rewarding experience of engaging in school outreach. The sessions at primary schools were particularly memorable; the children’s questions are often wonderfully wild, funny, and insightful!\nThe second area that truly excites me is shaping the new projects coming into the team. I’m particularly keen to see how data science can effectively support the digital transformation initiatives within the NHS, as well as inform crucial operational decisions.\nIt’s fascinating to observe how different teams operate and identify how data science can provide valuable assistance. I play a key role in scoping these projects to ensure they not only meet but potentially exceed the initial requirements.\nIncreasingly, we’re seeing colleagues interested in leveraging the power of AI in their work, which brings exciting new challenges, opportunities, and collaborations for our team."

    "text": "If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?\nMy advice for aspiring data scientists would be two things:\nFirstly, cultivate the ability to explain complex, technical, and potentially dry subjects in a simple and engaging manner. Think to yourself, ‘Can I explain what I’m doing to a 9-year-old in a way that they would not only understand but also find captivating?’ Channel your inner kids’ TV presenter or science journalist!\nA great way to achieve this is by using everyday analogies. Try comparing a project, process, or problem to a familiar, everyday situation. Recently, when explaining technical concepts, I’ve used examples like visiting a restaurant or using an iPhone.\nIf you can help people, feel intelligent (rather than prioritising making yourself appear intelligent!), they are far more likely to engage with and remember what you’re trying to convey.\nIt’s natural, after completing a complex piece of work, to want to highlight its difficulty and intricacy. While sometimes this is necessary, generally, strive to find common ground and make the concepts accessible.\nSecondly, ensure you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of the data science technique or approach you’re using, including its potential weaknesses as well as its strengths compared to other methods.\nIn an age where we can execute complicated processes and code with a few clicks, it’s not always mandatory to delve into the underlying statistical models. However, to build your own confidence and effectively explain your work to others, this understanding of the fundamentals is, for me, paramount. It also equips you to critically evaluate the next ‘new big thing’ that emerges. Aim to be a cynical optimist in your approach.\n\nWe hope you found this interview with Sarah Culkin insightful. Her journey and advice offer valuable perspectives for those interested in contributing to the growing field of data science within the NHS.

    "text": "Welcome to the latest Professional Development newsletter, brought to you by the Data Science skilled team Professional Development Functional Team.\nThe newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.\nThere are some legacy NHS Digital items which we have identified with❗\nIf you cannot access something of interest to you, please reach out.\nThanks for reading! – PD newsletter team\n\nHealth and Care Analytics Conference\n\nThis month some of the NHS England Data Science team went to the Health and Care Analytics Conference (HACA) 2024, hosted in Telford. The team had various talks, posters and workshops delivered at the conference about our work and projects. Warren Davies reports back.\n\n\n\nNHS England RAP Star Warren Davies giving a talk at HACA on RAP Principles\n\n\nAt the HACA conference 2024 I gave a talk on RAP to a huge crowd, over 4,000 people, great people, the best people. OK more like 70. And I also helped run workshops on Python and RAP. I highly recommend the experience overall. I gained the following XP:\n\n+10 Planning – it’s tricky to plan when you don’t know in advance the size and experience of the audience (in the workshops we opted to give a flavour of what was possible, along with some simple exercises people could follow along with).\n+10 Schmoozing – it is actually very easy. People are very happy to talk about their work and how you might be able to help them.\n+20 Resilience – public speaking can be nerve wracking but that is OK, it’s just weakness leaving the body.\n\nBut you also have the opportunity to help other people. It’s easy to take for granted in NHS England that we basically have a huge bunch of geniuses at our beck and call that that we can pester and learn from every day. But not every analyst in the wider NHS and health world is so lucky. Within trusts and regional organisations, there are often small teams - or even individuals - who do similar work to us but don’t have the kind of support we do.\nWith events like HACA we have the chance to connect with them, and point them to resources and communities they might not know about. Which not only helps them, but gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside too (incidentally, it also ticks a whole load of those “Sharing knowledge” boxes on the competency framework…).\nYou should definitely go next time. You will build your networking skills, help people out, and get loads of great examples you can use when you apply for that promotion. Plus, everyone loves a road trip right?\n\nSchool Placement\n\nIn July, the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team hosted a school placement, hosting five students from a London based secondary school to teach them about our work and show them some of the skills they would need to start a career in data science. Liz Kelly describes her experience, working to prepare this week to show the school pupils what our team does, and give them a taste of how it might be to work with us.\n\n\n\nSome really happy cartoon kids on a school placement, ready to learn about the NHS England Data Science team.\n\n\nThis was a rewarding yet difficult task, involving a lot of admin, paperwork, and even a conversation with NHS England lawyers to check we were dotting all our i’s and crossing all our t’s. Naturally, after all this, there were still the dreaded tech setup issues (sigh). But Chaeyoon did an amazing job at fixing them in record time, so the students could still get the most out of their placement.\nAs a graduate in the Data Science team, I know first-hand how valuable it is for colleagues to take time to explain the various cogs in the NHS system. Because let’s be honest, it’s a bit complicated. So, we made sure to cover as many areas as possible to help with this understanding.\nAbout half of the data scientists (a total of 22) met students during the placement week, alongside more indirect engagements from others such as helping with the training materials. The students rotated through four data science teams and were introduced to two methods of data science ways of working: python programming and collaborative works on GitHub. At the end of the placement week, they had a mock interview and an optional task to build a classifier function with if-else conditions to find which group (from the placement sessions) they could match to the session information. It is incredible to think some of the students had never touched programming before and yet, by the end of the week, they had a basic understanding of Python!\nI personally enjoyed the challenge of organising the timetable for the students and leading them through workshops and career talks. Who doesn’t love a good to-do list! And since I don’t cover this kind of outreach in my day-to-day role, this was an excellent opportunity. I could tick off those leadership and mentoring competencies, not to mention dealing with complexity (those pesky access and tech issues). I will admit, teaching a group over Teams is trickier than I thought, especially interactive sessions. The students were eager to discuss and answer questions but sometimes their meeting room microphone didn’t quite catch what they were saying … or perhaps it was just me and the London accent.\nAs this was the first of its kind, it took a while to discover all the rules and policies. Now we have done this once, subsequent placements should be a lot easier to host. We have collated the resources used here, currently accessible to those in NHSE DS GitHub team. We are working to collate and publish our resources more widely in the future.\nAs soon as we say “I work for the NHS”, peoples first thoughts are frontline staff, not data scientists. It wasn’t until I was graduating university that I stumbled across data science roles in the NHS and even then, it was purely accidental. When I think back to my time at school I would have loved to do this work experience week in the NHS.\nI know I am not alone when I say just how important it is to introduce young people to Data Science, particularly in the NHS. This provides them with more avenues to follow and more ideas of what is out there. It makes the world of possibilities just that bit bigger.\nOnce again, thank you to everyone involved. I’m sure you’ll agree the placement week was a success, just perhaps short of a few tea and biscuit breaks. The students are not used to being at a desk all day!\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

There is more than one way to leverage this recent breakthrough. You can create a chatbot by directly “plugging” to a LLM and start asking questions. However, LLMs are limited to the information available in the data they have seen during their training. So how to build a chatbot that will be able to answer questions related to documents that the model has never seen. One solution is to use a technique called “Retrieval Augmented Generation” (RAG). After an introduction of Generative AI and transformers, we will go through the RAG logic and explore its benefits and potential drawbacks. The talk is intended for anyone interested in generative AI and its potential applications.\n\n\nTranslational Science Methods Club: Explainable AI\nTuesday 20th Aug 2024, 15:30 - 17:00, Virtual Seminar\nThe theme of this T-SciM event will be explainable AI (XAI). This refers to a range of approaches that seek to design or evaluate ways to make the outputs of artificial intelligence algorithms more interpretable. Such explainability is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying the models computations and determine how trustworthy and generalisable their results are.\nWe will be joined by 3 speakers, who will give short talks introducing their work on XAI, followed by a panel discussion with questions and prompts from the audience.\nSpeakers include: Dr Ahmed Salih, Dr Tapabrata (Rohan) Chakraborty and Sophie Martin (ex-PhD intern with the NHSE DS team).\n\n\nHealth Data Science Seminar Series: Transforming Healthcare: AI in Health Data Science\nThursday 12th September 2024, 14:00 - 15:30, Teams\nThis series of seminars presents an exciting opportunity to hear about recent developments in health data science, generate ideas and help build the health data science community. It is hosted by the ONS’s Data Science Campus and Health Analysis Team in partnership with Health Data Research UK (HDR UK).\nThe Health Data Science Seminar series provides a dedicated space for data scientists, policymakers, health professionals, academics, epidemiologists, statisticians and other members of the data science community to come together and explore the potential of data science, to help improve health and health policy.\nThis event will feature presentations from guest speakers including:\nDr Siegfried Karl Wagner - Ophthalmologist and senior research fellow, University College London Professor Christopher Yau - Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Turing AI Fellow, University of Oxford\n\n\nData Science Festival: Oktoberfest\nSaturday 19th October 2024, 9am-5pm, CodeNode London\nApply for a FREE ballot entry to this years DSF Oktoberfest.

These discussions aren’t recorded, we want to make everyone feel as comfortable as possible to discuss their thoughts and ideas on whatever topic we are talking about.\nMost recently our discussion focussed on professional development in our current roles, and how we can support others to take advantage of the opportunities they have.\nOne discussion point that came up in a few groups was the difference between purposeful development time versus just doing the job and where the line is drawn between them. It was felt that a lot of the work we do involves researching and learning about different techniques and methods, and that this could really also be considered professional development.\nA theme that also came up across groups was the lack of time available for dedicated professional development for topics and areas that are separate from the day to day work. A lot of people felt like they had limited time for self-directed study, and that getting the job done took priority which led to professional development taking a back seat. In order to mitigate this, people suggested blocking out calendar time in advance in order to pre-book learning time, although sticking to this can be hard if you’re busy.\nWe had members from various NHS teams present at this discussion and there was also a definite split, with some teams feeling like they were allowed a lot more time and were encouraged to take development opportunities more than others. This highlighted a bit of a difference in team culture, and there was discussion about how those who are allotted more time could support those without.\nThe most engaging discussion point? Whether a hot dog is a sandwich. We’re still split on it.\nWant to get the calendar invite for the next one? Sign up to our mailing list.\nWant to host a Discussion?

These constraints limit their ability to process long sequences effectively, and make it more challenging to achieve stable and efficient training and deployment.\nThis paper delves into these issues and proposes SpikingBrain, a new family of brain-inspired models designed to help combat these challenges. The architecture is based on how biological neurons work in the brain, particularly around their adaptive spiking threshold. This threshold, which can dynamically change, enables event-driven copmutation which can enhance computational efficiency.\n\n\nDefeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference\nReproducibility is a bedrock of scientific progress. However, it’s remarkably difficult to get reproducible results out of large language models (LLMs). For example, you might observe that asking ChatGPT the same question multiple times provides different results. However, even when we adjust the temperature down to 0 (that is, the LLM always chooses the highest probability token, which is called greedy sampling), LLM APIs are still not deterministic in practice.\nA group from the Thinking Machine Lab dive into what contributes to the non-deterministic behaviour of LLMs and explain how to defeat nondeterminism and obtain truly reproducible results in LLM inference. They prompt an LLM to “tell me about Richard Feynman” and found that when batch-invariant kernels are enabled, all 1000 completions are identical!\n\n\nGOSH shares study into AI scribe pilot across nine London NHS sites\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital has shared results around using AI-scribe technology across a nine London NHS sites, evaluating the impact of the TORTUS tool. Key findings included that clinicians spent “nearly a quarter” more time directly with patients, with findings reportedly already being used to shape national policy and inform NHSE guidance on AI-enabled scribing.\nThis article describes the TORTUS AI-scribing tool and discusses how AI-scribing could add clinician capacity per day and increase the number of patients seen per shift.\n\n\nDawn of A New Era of Primary Prevention in Medicine\nRecent groundbreaking reports highlight our newfound potential to prevent diseases\nPrimary Prevention means a disease or condition is averted. Currently, we have secondary prevention in place, for example screening for cancer, which focuses on finding cancer at an early stage. This Ground Truths post is about the new and exciting opportunity for achieving primary prevention, and discusses the profound economic benefit of primary prevention for reducing the cost of treatments. The post references various new papers that have recently come out such as Personal Health Agent, Epigenetic Organ Age Clocks and Continuous Protein Monitoring.\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

At our 2024 session, we explored the hype, hope, and hands-on examples of AI in action. But as the dust settles, one truth is becoming increasingly clear: AI can’t deliver on its promise without strong data foundations.\nEnter 2025, and organisations are starting to feel the strain: AI projects are stalling, models are drifting, and demonstrating value is becoming increasingly challenging. Why? Because we’ve rushed headlong into the future without checking, we packed the essentials. Good data. Shared language. Trusted processes. Skilled people.\nJoin The Data Crowd for an unmissable afternoon of exploration, challenge, and connection as we dive into the opportunities (and hard truths) of data and AI in practice.\nWhether you’re a data-curious graduate, a data team leader, or a Chief Data Officer shaping strategy at scale, this event will inspire new thinking, offer real-world lessons, and challenge assumptions.\n\n\nAI in the NHS 2025\nTuesday 14th October, 14:00 - 17:15, Online\nWith the opportunities for artificial intelligence in health care expanding and new technologies igniting political and media debate, the drive to understand how to effectively and responsibly implement AI in the NHS continues unabated.\nAt our 2025 event, we’ll hear international perspectives on how to capitalise on AI in healthcare and navigate the challenges of effectively implementing the technology. With the government’s NHS AI strategic roadmap due this autumn, we’ll consider what the UK can learn from these experiences.\nJoin stakeholders from across the NHS, government, tech industry, investors, academia and the charity sector who are leading the strategic direction, development and implementation of AI and technology in health care.\n\n\nPrivacy is Power - Data Ethics and Society Reading Group\nTuesday 11th November, 12:00 - 13:00, Online,\nWednesday 26th November, 13:00 - 14:00, Online,\nJoin us at the Data Ethics & Society Reading Group to discuss Privacy is Power by Carissa Véliz.\n“Digital technology is stealing our personal data and with it our power to make free choices.

With the popularity of LLM’s for everyday use growing, the total energy consumption is rising. Being aware of the energy consumption of your code is not only more important than ever, it is also easier than ever to do so.\nCodeCarbon is a open-source Python package designed to help you estimate the carbon footprint of computing tasks, particularly for machine learning and other high-performance computing workloads. It does this by estimating your hardware electricity power consumption (GPU + CPU + RAM) and applies the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done. More is explained about this calculation in the Methodology section of the documentation.\nAdd this (or any other tracker you know of!) to your next pipeline and start taking steps toward more sustainable computing.\n\n\n\nNHS Python Community - What is Python?\nCurious about Python in healthcare?

    "text": "How did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nMy journey to data science at the NHS is a blend of engineering roots, a pandemic pivot, and a strong personal connection to healthcare.\nMy academic background began with an Integrated Master’s in Aerospace Engineering. I was captivated by the problem-solving inherent in understanding how complex systems, particularly aircraft, function. This fascination with engineering persists, as evidenced by my continued interest in aerospace content.\nA pivotal moment that hinted at my future direction occurred during a second-year Business Simulation module. We were tasked with managing car companies within a simulated European market. I developed a comprehensive spreadsheet to optimise production, enabling us to create cost-effective cars with popular features. I would go on to make many more spreadsheets, including one that calculated my mark margins for upcoming exams to allow me to still graduate with first class honours.\nFollowing graduation, I joined a small engineering firm, where I contributed to the development of control software for automated test rigs. We built custom rigs to test components like aircraft actuators and truck brake assemblies, using the visual programming language LabVIEW. This involved wiring code sections together, and I still recognise LabVIEW’s distinctive interface in various applications, including airport airbridge controls.\nUnfortunately, I lost my job around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, coinciding with a severe contraction of the job market. During the lockdown, I used the time to learn Python, which sparked a realisation that I wanted to pursue a career in data science. While I’d always enjoyed numbers, spreadsheets, problem-solving, and programming, the pandemic provided the catalyst to connect these interests.\nI enrolled in a Data Science conversion Master’s program at Loughborough University, joining the inaugural cohort of the degree. The decision to apply to the NHS was deeply personal. My father was a GP and healthcare consultant, and my then-girlfriend (now wife), was training to be a doctor. The NHS’s mission resonated with me, and I discovered the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme. I applied and was fortunate enough to be accepted.\nI began my role at the NHS just two weeks after submitting my Master’s project."

    "text": "Once you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?\nJoining the NHS was a real whirlwind, but in the best way possible! I’ve been here for three years now, starting at NHS Digital and then transitioning into NHS England after the merger. My first two years were spent on the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme, and since then, I’ve been working as a full-fledged Data Scientist.\nThat Graduate Scheme was incredible. We were the first cohort of its kind, a group of just under twenty, and we kicked things off with an intense eight-week coding bootcamp. It was a fantastic bonding experience – we’d be hammering away at code and then decompressing with board games during breaks.\nMy first placement on the NHS Spine project, which is this massive, intricate system connecting all sorts of different NHS systems. Because it’s so complex, everyone was constantly learning, and that made it a really supportive environment for a newbie like me. Plus, I got to see firsthand what a well-oiled DevOps team looked like, which really shaped my approach moving forward, especially when I landed in the Business Intelligence Development Team.\nThat team was all about building Tableau dashboards and trying to standardise things. My manager asked me to dig into the Tableau API. They had this super slow, manual process for checking dashboards, and I realised we could automate it with Python. So, I built a proof-of-concept testing framework, which was a great chance to put my NHS Spine lessons to work in a totally different area.\nMy final placement was with the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) Squad. We were all about promoting good coding practices for analytics and helping teams automate their workflows. Basically, we were bringing in the best of data and software engineering into the data science and analytics space. In that role, I got to write articles, create training guides, and even run workshops. We also did these ‘Engagements’ with other analytical teams, helping them improve their processes. After a year, I passed my end-of-scheme interview and got promoted to a Band 7 Data Scientist, staying with the RAP Squad and leading those Engagements.\nMore recently, I moved to the National Secure Data Environment Service Team, or the SDE Data Wranglers. We make sure researchers get the right, pseudonymised data. While there, I also got to work on a side project developing an ML-powered tool to detect potentially sensitive information in huge datasets. It was a fun challenge, working with Docker containers, PySpark, and figuring out how to deploy ML models in a clustered computing environment.\nOverall, it’s been a really varied and rewarding experience. Each role has built on the last, and I’ve learned so much about the NHS and the power of data."

    "text": "What are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nRight now, I’m embedded within an analytical team focused on commissioning specialised NHS services. It’s a really interesting area, and I’m helping them boost their Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) compliance, automate some of their manual processes, and bring in some Python expertise to diversify their toolkit.\nOne project I’m particularly excited about is automating their monthly reporting. We’ve managed to cut the processing time from a week down to just a few minutes, which is a huge win! It’s incredibly rewarding to free up my colleagues’ time, allowing them to focus on more impactful, data-driven insights rather than repetitive tasks.\nI’m also personally driven to achieve something new for me; building a pipeline that meets Gold RAP compliance standard; essentially, a fully automated and packaged analytical process. We’re facing some interesting challenges, but I’m confident that overcoming them will pave the way for more efficient and robust projects in the future."

    "text": "If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?\nIf I could give some advice to someone starting out in data science, I’d say:\n\nConsider a conversion master’s if it’s feasible. Mine was a game-changer. It accelerated my learning so much, and it gave me a strong portfolio to show potential employers right away.\n\nDive into online resources, but don’t get lost in them. There’s a wealth of information out there! Kaggle Learn is a fantastic starting point.\nMaster Git and GitHub. Seriously, this is crucial. I even helped create a workshop for the NHS-R Community and some training materials on it, which you can find on the RAP Community of Practice website. Learning Git and GitHub will also allow you to use GitHub codespaces, and avoid the pain of setting up your local environment.\nDon’t just stick to tutorials. It’s easy to get stuck in tutorial hell. Find a simple, personal project that excites you. Mine was building a tool to optimise my Fantasy F1 team. Passion projects are a great way to build a portfolio and showcase your skills.\n\nBasically, combine structured learning with practical application, and don’t be afraid to explore your own interests!"

See the full calendar here❗, and a small selection below.\nRecently, we held another Data Science Discussion, where we encourage people to look into a different area or use case of data science than they might strictly look at in their day job and spark discussion on a peer-to-peer level.\nThis time we delved into the intriguing topic of data science and democracy, hosted by Mia Noonan.\nMia kicked off the discussion by asking the group to consider the different ways data science could interact with and potentially reshape the political landscape. One of the key ideas presented was the concept of AI-driven profiles that could be created based on an individual’s opinions and values, with the potential to vote on bills and acts on their behalf. This led to a lively debate on the implications of such a system, and what type of democracy we’d like to see AI help facilitate- representative, direct or deliberative.\nThroughout the session, the group expressed a healthy dose of skepticism, particularly regarding the biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems. Concerns were raised about the potential for AI to reflect and even exacerbate existing biases, as well as the broader implications for democracy and personal agency. The discussion highlighted the complex and often controversial nature of combining AI with politics, but also the potential for innovative applications that could transform how we engage with governance.\nThe Professional Development Functional Team is excited to continue hosting these monthly Data Science Discussions. If you have a data science topic you’re passionate about and would like to share with others, please reach out to us to host a session. The format is designed to be collaborative and conversational, with most of the session taking place in breakout rooms, so all you need is a spark of inspiration to get the conversation started.\nInterested in learning a bit more about this topic?\nStay tuned for an update on what seminars & show and tells will look like in the new team.

    "text": "Welcome to the latest newsletter from the Data Science Community for Health and Care, brought to you by the NHS England Data Science Professional Development Functional Team.\nThe newsletter team are always happy to receive constructive feedback, and we invite you to send us any contributions you may have.\nIf you cannot access something of interest to you, please reach out.\nThanks for reading! – newsletter team\nwritten by Jennifer Struthers\nIf you are a regular reader of this newsletter you might have seen the RPySOC event plugged each month, which was at long last held last week. The conference was a celebration of all things R/Python/Open-Source, and everyone there was excited to show off the projects they had been involved in over the last year.\nThere were at least 100 people gathered in the Birmingham International Conference Centre, and more present online where the talks were being live-streamed. People seemed to be saying hello to colleagues that they hadn’t seen in a while, and sitting down at tables to meet new people and discuss all things healthcare and coding.\nI went along to present my project on experimenting with open-source dashboarding tools and packages, which I had undertaken earlier this year to develop my data visualisation and general coding skills. It was a brief talk, with just a 15 minute timeslot, but I got surprisingly more nervous as the morning went on. I’ve given variants of this presentation before, and I was confident in answering any questions on it, really I should have been fine. However this was the first time since I was in university that I had stood in front of people and spoken to them, instead of hidden behind my computer screen talking to my slides. Strange how something like hybrid working has completely changed something as fundamental as giving a presentation.\nLuckily, my fears were unfounded. The stage lights were so bright I couldn’t see anyone anyway and I could pretend I was still at my desk, talking at my slides like normal. Before I knew it I was back at my table and could breathe and enjoy the rest of the conference, while typing away to answer all the questions and comments that had come through during my talk.\nThere was a Slack channel organised for questions which meant that online viewers had the same chance to ask questions as in-person attendees, and the speakers could take their time afterwards to answer extra questions and give links. Almost every single presentation included links to public GitHub repositories, and people were actively encouraged to check out the code, and re-use whatever they wanted to.\nThe whole conference was focused on sharing, collaborating and supporting others, regardless of where they were at in the coding journey. It was a great gathering of a community (full of provided food and coffee!), and what really struck me was how keen everyone was to get involved, give people pointers, and congratulate them on the work they had done. The talks were evenly distributed between Python and R users, and everything pitched at a level anyone with a coding interest could understand. If you’ve got a project you’re working on and are keen to share the results in front of an audience, I would definitely recommend next year’s RPySOC!\nThe conference organisers will be sharing the recordings of the talks, along with slides and links, at a later date so that the knowledge can be shared on and on.\nThe data science team at NHS England hold Data Science Discussions on a monthly (ish!) basis. These discussions are typically informal, and in a small group to encourage as much discussion as possible. The most recent Data Science Discussion was delivered by Ben Wallace, one of the senior data scientists within the team.\nBen was keen to introduce the idea of science communication and how to get your ideas across correctly. We discussed how to explain complex topics such as lossy compression in an easily understandable manor. Through examples we discussed when explanations were too complex, too simple, or just right, before having a go ourselves at explaining tricky data science terms.\nInterested in learning more about science communication? Check out these resources below:\nThere are a myriad of data science communities doing excellent work to link people, share resources and support people in their careers and personal projects: check out some of them below and get involved!\nGot a project to showcase? An event to plug? A tip to share?\nWe want to hear from you!

Read about the challenge and her experience below.\nI was a part of one of the teams who were finalists at the civil service data challenge (CSDC) which is an annual event where teams come together to pitch innovative ideas to secure funding. Think of it like Dragon’s Den or Shark Tank but with friendlier judges who are all senior data leaders from across the public sector. A multidisciplinary team chosen from the applicants across public sector were tasked to build a product roadmap for RouteCare, an NHS geospatial tool, that can be pitched for funding. We were among the four finalists, and we came a close second place (still gutted!). While it meant we didn’t receive the funding, it was a huge achievement for the team! We were also the only all-women-panel which inspired several members of the audience who kindly congratulated us for our presentation - a highlight for me.\nNow for some behind the scenes. This was not a hackathon but an entire “side” project involving multiple stakeholders. Once we were selected after the semi-finals, each team was allocated a mentor from the judging panel and ours was John Quinn, Chief Information Officer, NHS England. This helped in securing senior management buy-in straightaway, however expanded the vision of the product. John’s involvement opened several doors for us including obtaining buy-in from Helen Balsdon, Chief Nursing Information Officer, NHS England and partnership with Google to further build this tool.\nWe however lost a few team members to churn, and I took on the leadership of the tool. This was an excellent opportunity to pick up skills including different styles of leadership (technical and motivational), influencing senior stakeholders, collaboration with team members with diverse backgrounds, commercial negotiation and most of all, public speaking (presenting to a 200-member audience whilst being filmed isn’t my idea of fun).\nI would highly recommend applying for the next cohort of CSDC if you would like an overall development opportunity which is unique and will certainly be a valuable experience for your career!\nLots of exciting things coming up!

We aim to showcase the fantastic individuals who contribute to the NHSE Data Science Profession and provide valuable insights for those considering a career in Data Science within the healthcare sector.\nThis week our interviewee is Sam Hollings, who is departing NHS England after a seven-year career. In his most recent role as Head of Coding and Data Standards (and formerly as Principal Data Scientist), Sam was a driving force for improving data practices across the organisation. He is widely known for his passionate championing of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP). As he prepares for a new chapter in Italy with his family, he kindly agreed to share his reflections and the lessons learned from his work.\n\n\nRead more…\n\n\nHow did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nI kind of ended up in data science by accident, though each part of my career has related to data, and usually making sense of large quantities of data!\nMy degree was in Physics and Astronomy, with the final project on hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies and analysing their outputs. This involved a bunch of big data analysis (in Python), but back in 2011 it was the early days of what we now call data science, so I didn’t know this term. I did do some clustering and regression though!\nI further professionalised my data skills as a Band 5 in the NHS Information Centre and, crucially, built up my knowledge about NHS secondary care data and the structure of the NHS. Changing to the PhD for the next four years probably wasn’t the wisest choice career-wise, but I wanted to do some work nearer patients. Working in a hospital and picking up bone samples actually taken from patients was really interesting. Again, I also further developed my big data skills through my genomics work and the clustering I did to make sense of the 50,000 genes I measured.\nWhen I came back to the NHSIC (now called the HSCIC, which later became NHS Digital), I built up my programming skills in the data engineering team, but had started to develop a plan to move into the exciting and growing field of data science. I did a bunch of personal study and projects, and then when I got made redundant, I saw my chance. Through the internal process to find me a new job, I got reallocated to the data science team in London! I was really excited by this, as the NHS has some incredibly rich (and huge) patient data, and the chance to apply these new and developing techniques for the benefit of patients and the public was too good to pass up!\n\n\nOnce you joined the NHS, what was that experience like? What different roles and teams have you been a part of, and how have they shaped your career?\nI’ve worked on and off for the NHS since 2011, with a break between late 2013 and late 2018 where I did my PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) - though I also worked in a hospital during that time, St James’s in Leeds.\nThough my degree was in Astronomy, in the final year I started to take a real interest in health and aspired to be a Medical Physicist. I did a few work experience placements in Radiology and Medical Physics departments. I didn’t get onto the scientist training programme unfortunately, so the first proper job I got after uni was at “the NHS Information Centre” (NHSIC) as a Band 5 Data Engineer (though back then they were called “Information Analysts”, oddly) in the reference data team. I’ll be honest, I kind of blagged my interview as my SQL knowledge was not great (they didn’t care about Python!), but I was a quick learner and soon was helping contribute and improve things. Automating the processes that brought reference data files into a corporate database wasn’t glamorous, but it was impactful, and I learnt so much about production products, working with people who felt you were threatening their job, and crucially, helping them see the opportunities this type of automation can bring. I got promoted to Band 6 after one year, then after another year I felt the itch to return to academia, so I embarked on my PhD.\nI did a four-year Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, eventually focussing on studying how doping a type of bioactive glass-ceramic with Strontium made it “osteoinductive”. I did do proper cell biology work in a lab (and got to see a whole room of sawn-in-half cadavers), but the part I enjoyed most was the big data analysis of the genomics experiments I did, and again, helping my biology colleagues write programmes to automate some of their repetitive image processing.\nAt the end of the PhD I was a bit burnt out from research, so I came back to my old team as a Band 7 Data Engineer in the NHSIC (now called the HSCIC, which later became NHS Digital) where Python was now in vogue. I really learnt a lot about how to programme professionally - code version control, tests, pulling data down from Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), dev, test, live, the works! I then got made redundant, and through the internal process to find me a new job I got reallocated to the data science team in London!\nOver the next five years, I established myself as a data scientist, getting promoted to Band 8a and working on a number of different projects - COVID patient forecasting, helping set up the Trusted Research Environment (TRE) - I was the original TRE Data Wrangler in the business! - and spending almost three years spreading Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) alongside a great number of incredible colleagues.\nThe final chapter of my career here was moving to Data Architecture where I continued the legacy of the RAP work, establishing coding and data standards in the business.\n\n\nWhat are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nMy current work in the Data Architecture team has been mostly about establishing a reusable code library within the business and beyond, with the intention of it being public. You can see our prototype here! Many people in the business write the same old code… like how there are 20-something different algorithms for NHS number validation. We just need ONE - agreed, made to a high standard, signed off, and easy to consume. Alongside this, I’ve been working with others to clarify open sourcing, code documentation, code metadata, and reusable code standards, so it’s easier for our colleagues to adopt best practice.\nAlongside this, I’ve led the work on establishing some Data Principles for NHS England. These are basic statements, often quite obvious, that act as a guiding light for how we use data. Ours are not published yet, but a great example is the data principles released by the ONS.\nI also spent a while doing work on LLMs and other AI tools, including going to work for Downing Street for two months on an AI taskforce building a RAG-based tool for the Deputy Prime Minister. I tried to bring this learning back and share it with our colleagues through this interactive notebook: LLM Tutorial.\nProbably the project I’m most well known for is “Reproducible Analytical Pipelines” (RAP). I really rode on the coat-tails of others, with colleagues such as Connor Quinn and Helen Richardson really getting it going in NHS Digital. My team and I focussed on helping people and making RAP interesting and fun, such as by having Christmas-themed sets of posts about RAP, and by challenging ourselves to mention it in nearly every meeting, including All Hands Calls! We trained a number of teams, who themselves went on to train others, so probably hundreds of analysts benefited from our work, and this isn’t even counting the teams from other organisations in London, Canada, France, and elsewhere who adopted our guidance! This work was really rewarding as it genuinely helped our colleagues. We managed to help colleagues reduce some pieces of work that took two people two weeks to run, to only take one person 40 minutes! We also tracked the success of the programme by measuring how many teams had reached baseline, silver, and gold RAP, and tracking how this changed each month, focussing our efforts on where people were getting stuck.\nIn terms of communication, I’m a big fan of using humour to make even the driest subject interesting. You have to use it sparingly, but when used at the right point, it can really help you hammer home the points you’re trying to make. I also use a lot of metaphors, describing technical things in terms of chocolate bars, cakes, vehicles - anything which allows me to get the core idea across in a way people can understand, and that feels real to them.\n\n\nIf you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?\nThe most important advice is just start playing with the tools and having a go. Sign up to Kaggle, do their free training, have a go at a few competitions, but then find a real-world problem or some real-world data and start your own project. Learn step by step by reading on Medium, or via books or other sources. It’s how many of us have picked up data science!\n\nWe hope you found this interview with Sam Hollings interesting. His journey demonstrates how curiosity, persistence, and a passion for making complex topics accessible can transform not just individual careers, but entire organisations. Sam’s work on RAP has improved the way hundreds of analysts work across the NHS and beyond, proving that technical excellence combined with humour and effective communication can drive real cultural change.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Data Scientists working in Healthcare, you can read our previous iterations of the ‘Interview with a Data Scientist’ on the NHS England Data Science Website.\n\n\n\n\nOctober Analyst X Data Science Huddle\n\nRecently, the Data Science Community for Health and Care was invited to present at an AnalystX Huddle. We introduced who we are and various projects from our collaborators, NHS England Data Science and Applied AI Team, NHS Business Service Authority Data Science Team and the Department of Health and Social Care Data Science Team.\nIt was an excellent opportunity for us to showcase the amazing and varied work happening in the data science space across the health care system. We hope those who attended found it interesting, and we wanted to thank the AnalystX team for giving us the opportunity to present.\nMissed the session?

These include action on employment, the environment, housing, transport, and the economy. The government’s devolution agenda presents a vital opportunity for both newly established and existing Strategic Authorities to consider how they can maximize these powers to improve the health of their populations and reduce health inequalities.\nThis free one-day conference will be led by the Health Foundation, with support from the Mayoral Regions Programme (run on behalf of 10 Mayoral Strategic Authorities by the West Midlands Combined Authority). It will bring together colleagues from Strategic Authorities and their partners from across England to explore how regional leadership can drive better health outcomes.\nThe event will provide an opportunity to discuss embedding health in all policies in Mayoral Regions, working in partnership to improve health, and delivering local growth for health. We will explore examples of good practice, highlight opportunities and challenges, and offer space to learn from peers.\n\n\nONS Local Workshop: Building interactive onboarding tutorials in Power BI\nThursday 6th November, 09:30 - 11:00, Online\nBirmingham City Council have developed and run the Birmingham City Observatory, a public, open data platform on a wide range of characteristics of the city. Danny O’Neill, its creator, is an expert on building Power BI dashboards.\nWant your Power BI reports to guide users, not just display data? In this hands-on session, we’ll explore how to create interactive onboarding tutorials right inside your reports using layers, bookmarks, and clever design tricks. Whether you’re introducing new dashboards or making complex reports more user-friendly, you’ll learn practical ways to build guided experiences that actually stick.\nPerfect for Power BI developers, analysts, and anyone who wants their reports to speak for themselves.\nThis event is free and open to all; however, we anticipate it will be of most interest to anyone working with Power BI dashboards to analyse data.\n\n\nPrivacy is Power - Data Ethics and Society Reading Group\nTuesday 11th November, 12:00 - 13:00, Online\nWednesday 26th November, 13:00 - 14:00, Online\nJoin us at the Data Ethics & Society Reading Group to discuss Privacy is Power by Carissa Véliz.\n“Digital technology is stealing our personal data and with it our power to make free choices. To reclaim that power and democracy, we must protect our privacy. Short, terrifying, practical: Privacy is Power highlights the implications of our laid-back attitude to data and sets out how we can take back control.”\nWe will be holding two sessions over two weeks. The sessions will each focus on a different section of the book- but if you can’t make the one you want to come to, we can still guarantee a great conversation! Read more about our changes in our recent Data in Government blog post.\n\nTue 11 Nov 2025 12 PM - 1 PM (focusing on the first half of the book; the dangers the data economy poses and why we should care)\nWed 26 Nov 2025 1 PM - 2 PM (focusing on the second half of the book; what can we do about it, and whose responsibility is it?)\n\nThe event is free, but you need to sign up to reserve your spot. Signups for the first session will close on Monday 3rd November at 6pm. Signups for the second session close on Tuesday 18th November at 6pm.\n\n\nBridgeAI Adopters and Developers event\nThursday 13th November, 09:00 - 17:30, Wallacespace, London,\nJoin us for an exclusive in-person networking event designed to unite AI adopters, developers, and experts to accelerate innovation and responsible AI adoption across UK sectors.\nHosted by The Alan Turing Institute, this event offers a unique opportunity to connect with SMEs from across the BridgeAI ecosystem.

Understanding the factors which prolong the time between referral and treatment starting for cancer patients on pathways which cross healthcare providers is imperative to improved patient care. Three tumour pathways were analysed which involve transfer of patients between hospitals: sarcoma, urological, and head and neck cancers.\nSeveral factors impact on the time to first treatment including demographic characteristics, day of the week first seen and method of communicating the cancer diagnosis. In particular, it was found that head and neck patients from lower socioeconomic areas were more likely to have longer times from referral to treatment. Patients with sarcoma who were first seen on a Sunday are more likely to breach the 28-day faster diagnosis standard.\nThis analysis is an important first step in highlighting where focus is needed to improve cancer care pathways. Understanding and mitigating the factors influencing the length of time between referral and treatment could enhance the efficiency of cancer care pathways and, consequently, patient outcomes.\n\n\n\nJanuary Analyst X Data Science Huddle\n\nRecently, we had our January Analyst X Data Science Huddle!\nSenior Data Scientists from the NHS England Data Science and Applied AI Team presented their work on generating synthetic patient pathways and clinical notes using LLMs - a really interesting piece of work!\nMissed the session? Check out the recording and PowerPoint slides here, where you will also find the recordings of previous huddles.\n\n\nFebruary Analyst X Data Science Huddle\n\nTuesday 10th February 2026, 13:30 - 14:30, Online\nThe Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next Analyst X Data Science Huddle for February. The session will contain two slots, covering two projects:\n\nSlot 1 (13:30 – 14:00): Causal Inference for Intervention & Service Evaluations: Applications in North Central London (Presented by Jamie Wong) There is increasing interest in the application of causal inference methods to evaluate interventions and services within the NHS.\nIn this session, we will exploring what causal methods are, what types of methods are out there, and how they can be applied to impact evaluations to understand what works in improving services and outcomes for patients.\nThis will be accompanied by initial results from worked examples done within North Central London, as well as a preview of a causal handbook that is currently being written up online to guide analysts and data scientists in performing similar work going forward.\nSlot 2 (14:00 - 14:30): MM-HealthFair: Tackling Healthcare Bias in Multimodal AI Risk Prediction (Presented by Konstantin Georgiev) Innovations in digital health technology continue to drive novel applications of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence (MMAI) for risk prediction and decision support. MMAI algorithms demonstrate consistently superior capabilities over unimodal algorithms in forecasting health outcomes across most clinical domains. However, the specificity and selectivity of multi-source data collection can also influence models to amplify pre-existing disparities in routine healthcare data, such as embedding racial bias. Fusion models require appropriate safeguards to address healthcare biases and mitigate their potentially harmful effects across our broader population.\n\nTo address this global challenge, we developed the MM-HealthFair framework: an open-source toolkit for investigating fairness in MMAI algorithms for risk prediction.\nMM-HealthFair provides customisable data pipelines for multimodal fusion of tabular, time-series and free-text modalities leveraging the MIMIC-IV open database. It enables interrogation of healthcare biases in deep fusion models through quantitative fairness metrics (e.g. demographic parity, equal opportunity), uses explainability methods to compare multimodal feature interactions (MM-SHAP), and supports customisable adversarial debiasing at training time.\nOur work aims to promote the dissemination of knowledge regarding fairness in MMAI-guided decisions, working towards well-defined guidelines for risk prediction.\nThis event will be added to our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar, where we will add the abstract for the session and any further information.\nIf you would like to be invited to future events of ours, sign up to our mailing list!\n\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

The session will include two talks: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow, and Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare.\nAbstract: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow\nPoor admitted non-elective patient flow is a major issue for many acute trusts. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a useful tool for modelling patient pathways. This project used DES to model patient flow for non-elective admissions. The model was used to investigate how reductions in inpatient length of stay, non-criteria to reside, additional escalation beds and fluctuations in demand impact waits for admission in ED. The model allows testing of ad hoc scenarios, via a user-friendly streamlit app, and has also been used to provide evidence-based targets for inpatient length of stay and informed discussions about relevant flow metrics. In this talk I’ll discuss the model, how it works and some of the insights from the project and happy to answer any questions or receive any suggestions you may have!\nAbstract: Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare\nThe current methods used for data linkage or indexing in the healthcare industry follow deterministic algorithms that are not transparent to the end users and with often sub-optimal outcomes. Our work focuses on building and implementing a probabilistic algorithm that improves quality as well as explainability of the linkage. In this project we have used Splink, a UK Ministry of Justice probabilistic linkage Python package, to build a pipeline that links any health data set to the Personal Demographics Service (PDS), a dataset containing information about all patients registered to a GP in England, which acts as our linkage “spine”.\nWe have added this event to our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar, where you can find the calendar invite to access the event.\nIf you would like to be invited to future events of ours, sign up to our mailing list!\n\n\nThe Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme\n\nThe Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme teaches public sector analysts, clinicians and managers how to use data science and operational research techniques, as well as supporting them to apply these techniques in their organisations.\nThe full HSMA course experience is provided free of charge to people working in health, social care and policing organisations in England.\nThe full HSMA experience is a live, 15-month programme with two distinct phases: a 6 month training phase where participants learn the Python programming language, and a 9 month project phase where participants are supported to produce their own project using the new skills they have learned.\nRecently, two NHS England Data Scientists completed the HSMA course and have written a blog post about the course and their project.

We aim to showcase the fantastic individuals who contribute to data science within the healthcare sector and provide valuable insights for those considering a career in this field.\nThis week, our interviewee is Chris Beeley, the Head of Data Science at the Strategy Unit. Chris leads a team dedicated to improving the robustness and transparency of analytical work through methods such as Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP). His team is also a core component of the leadership of the NHS-R community, delivering code-first training and support across health and social care organisations.\n\n\nRead more…\n\n\nHow did you end up in data science in your healthcare organisation? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nI was originally supposed to be a clinical psychologist. I’ve always been interested in why people think and behave the way they do, and as the son of a dentist and a social worker, I always knew I wanted to work for the greatest employer in the world: the NHS.\nI headed off to university to study psychology and then worked as a healthcare assistant in psychiatric environments—a common way of gaining the experience required for clinical psychology. I worked for some time at Rampton, a high-secure hospital, on a ward for offenders with psychopathy and other forms of personality disorder. It was fascinating work, but while I was there, a PhD opportunity arose in the School of Psychology looking at daily behaviour and its association with personality disorders. The research was heavily focused on statistics, specifically mixed-effects models. After I finished, I continued working for the Trust that hosts Rampton. I started using R for stats, honestly only because it was free. This was back in 2008, during the “bad old days” when R wasn’t visible in the NHS and online help was not particularly friendly.\nI eventually got involved in a patient survey project that generated a lot of data quickly—hundreds of surveys a month. Not knowing any better, I initially used the same approach I had used in my PhD: Excel macros. One day, a lightbulb went off: “I know how to do stats with R. R is a programming language designed to manipulate data. I bet I can write an R program to process all these surveys”. With a bit of help from a contact in Canada, I managed to generate all the graphs with R. Then came another lightbulb moment: using {brew} (this was before RMarkdown) to write the entire report. When this newfangled thing called Shiny was released, I built a dashboard and eventually wrote a book about it.\nFor a long time, I didn’t know what to call myself because I was doing a bit of everything: building databases, writing dashboards, analysing data, and managing a Linux server to host Shiny applications. To my knowledge, nobody in the NHS was calling themselves a “data scientist” at the time. One day around 2016, I decided that’s what I was, so I just started calling myself a data scientist. I had one of those vague analytical job titles that didn’t mean much, and nobody objected to the change. Eventually, I saw the “Head of Data Science” role advertised at the Strategy Unit, got the job, and here I am.\n\n\nWhat are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nI’ve been working with data in the NHS for 21 years now, and I’ve enjoyed every role I’ve had. It isn’t always easy to see the immediate impact of my work compared to, say, my father, who spent his days physically fixing people’s teeth in the NHS. However, I think there are three things I’ve done that are particularly worthy of note.\nThe first is the work with patient experience I mentioned earlier. Qualitative patient experience data (free-text) is often not given the attention it deserves. My work generating reports and dashboards—and more recently, my team’s work on an open-source algorithm to classify patient experience data—has helped give this data a higher profile. I know it has helped healthcare organisations better understand what is happening for their patients.\nThe second is NHS-R, which recently merged with NHS Pycom to form the NHS Open Analytics community. As I mentioned, I learned R when it was almost non-existent in the NHS. I vowed that nobody else would have to suffer the same misery I did in 2008 learning R on my own. NHS-R is the fulfilment of that vow. I couldn’t dream of having the same impact alone as a community of analysts and data scientists can have by supporting each other, learning together, and cooperating across organisational boundaries. I consider NHS Open Analytics to be a vital part of the future of data and analytics across health and care.\nThe third is leading my team’s work on the open-source demand and capacity model for acute healthcare planning, commissioned by the New Hospital Programme.\nI don’t actually “do” any data science myself anymore; I don’t write code, review pull requests, or deploy products. I could do those things, but I choose not to because I want to ensure my work is valuable to the team, who are working hard on difficult problems. My role involves the essential “manager” tasks: arranging funding for equipment, sorting out Information Governance (IG), and demonstrating the value of our work to senior leaders. I also act as a buffer to manage the flow of work; everyone wants everything yesterday, so it’s my job to say “no” and explain what is possible.\nI set the strategic direction—such as adopting agile methodologies or creating product roles—but the energy and insight come from the team. My most important role is setting the culture. In our team, we share successes and failures, we listen to and help each other, and we treat each other as people first and data scientists second. We understand that mistakes are inevitable. When something goes wrong, we look at our processes to improve how we work as a team, and we never blame an individual. Everyone in the team is a wonderful person as well as a brilliant scientist; my job is to help everyone remember our values even when the chips are down and people are feeling tired or frustrated.\n\n\nIf you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be?\nI’m asked this a lot, and I don’t think I have one perfect answer. My story involved calling myself a data scientist after doing many random things with computers, but that path might not work as easily today given how the field has evolved. Instead, I’ll share some general advice that I hope will help someone in their career:\n\nBe nice to people on the way up, because you may meet them again on the way down.\nIf you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.\nWe are all smart; distinguish yourself by being kind.\nDon’t get hung up on demonstrating your “value” and spreading yourself thin—do your job, find a problem, solve it, highlight the solution, and move on.\nDon’t fall into the trap of thinking you need to have all the answers; if you don’t know something, just listen.\nI was supposed to be a clinical psychologist—do something you love every day and try not to worry too much about job titles and roles; you’ll find your way through.\n\n\nWe hope you found this interview with Chris Beeley insightful. His journey from clinical psychology to leading a data science team demonstrates the value of curiosity and the importance of building supportive communities like NHS-R. Chris’s contributions to both technical transparency and a supportive team culture show how data science leaders can make a lasting impact far beyond the code itself.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Data Scientists working in Healthcare, you can read our previous iterations of the ‘Interview with a Data Scientist’ on the NHS England Data Science Website.\n\n\n\n\nDecember Analyst X Data Science Huddle\n\nRecently, we had our December Analyst X Data Science Huddle!\nOracle kindly presented an in-depth exploration of how the NHS AnalystX community can leverage Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science - a robust collaborative platform designed to accelerate analytics and machine learning capabilities for healthcare organisations.\nMissed the session?

Here, we delve into the diverse career paths and impactful work of the talented individuals who make up the NHS England Data Science team. Our goal is to shine a light on the fantastic people driving the NHS Data Science Profession forward and to offer valuable perspectives for anyone considering a career in healthcare data science.\nThis week our interviewee is Mobolu Olowoyeye, a Data Scientist intern that joined the Data Science Team for eight weeks. Mobolu has a keen interest in AI ethics and has been involved in various projects that explore the intersection of technology and public good.\n\n\nRead more…\n\n\nHow did you end up in data science at the NHS? What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?\nUsing technology to drive positive change? There’s no place I’d rather be!\nMaking a real-world impact with technology has always been a key motivation for me, so when I saw how data science could make a difference in healthcare at the NHS, I was all in!\nI’ve just finished my first year of university and decided to spend my summer exploring possible career paths. I’m currently studying Artificial Intelligence at King’s College London. Yes, AI is officially a degree now; Crazy, right?\nI’ve always loved mathematics and computer science, but I specifically chose to study AI because of its multidisciplinary nature and my passion for AI Ethics. I became intrigued by AI ethics and understanding technology’s impact on society after watching the documentary ‘Coded Bias,’ which explored algorithmic bias in facial recognition technology. As an aspiring black woman in tech, seeing the impact of bias on people who look like me opened my eyes to a worrying reality. This inspired me to create an academic research poster on the topic, which I had the wonderful opportunity to present at the House of Lords!\nMy journey into data science began the summer after my GCSEs, with a four-week internship at QBE Insurance. I discovered I really enjoyed working with big data, and the following year, I had the chance to work at Circana, a big data and analytics company. I also gained a behind-the-scenes look at how tech companies use data to make decisions during my time as a data science mentee at Deliveroo.\nI also dipped into quantitative finance, gaining software engineering experience at G-Research and spending time at PDT Partners, a quantitative investment firm. While I found these experiences incredibly interesting, I realised I’m more drawn to data science with a social or public impact—not just numbers, but outcomes that improve people’s lives.\nThat’s where the NHS came in. I’ve always been passionate about using technology as a force for good, and data science in healthcare feels like exactly that. Whether it’s tackling health inequalities, improving patient outcomes, or making systems run more efficiently, its impact is real and visible.\nAlongside this internship, I’ve been an undergraduate research fellow at King’s, focusing on the ethical implications of AI in insurance law. I was also selected as one of 200 students for a BAME mentorship programme, where I was mentored by a PhD researcher working on ethics in language models.\nSo, between the technical side, the public good aspect, and my passion for ethical, responsible tech, data science in the NHS just made sense. Long-term, I’d love to work in AI policy or as a data ethicist, helping shape how technology is used fairly and safely across society. I’m also hoping to do a placement year in industry during my third year of university.\n\n\nWhat are you currently working on? Are there any projects that you’re particularly excited about, or that you feel are making a real difference? What impact are you having?\nI’ve been interning with the Data Science and Applied AI team for the past eight weeks. During this time, I’ve had the opportunity to learn, lead, and contribute in ways that have truly shaped my understanding of data science and AI in healthcare.\nOne of my most insightful experiences was speaking with front-line workers. I went to Epsom Hospital to talk with GPs about AI tools like Ambient Voice Technology and ran a small focus group to explore how AI impacts their daily work.\nMy main project has been the Synthetic Clinical Notes Project, where we create synthetic patient data to train an AI model for automating discharge summaries. When I joined, the dataset primarily used White British names and ethnicities. As someone from an ethnic minority with a culturally distinctive name, I recognised the risk of bias this could create. To address this, I’ve spent the last few weeks diversifying the naming data, researching names from a wide range of ethnic groups based on NHS staff survey statistics. By helping create a more representative dataset, I’ve contributed to making the project more ethically robust and ensuring it serves the public interest. I also helped update the style instructions for the clinicians who write these notes.\nAlongside my project work, I’ve been completing the Edward Jenner Leadership Programme, spoke on AI ethics at a GOSH training session, developed my Python skills through the Federated Data Platform pipeline, and contributed to discussions around data hazard labels. These experiences have all deepened my commitment to building responsible and impactful technology.\n\n\nIf you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be? And what resources have you found particularly helpful along the way that you can share?\nMy biggest piece of advice to an incoming data science intern would be to be inquisitive! Don’t hesitate to ask questions or ask for clarification. Many terms, concepts or abbreviations will probably be new to you and you don’t want to be left confused or behind in meetings or on your day-to-day.\nWhilst you are here to learn and gain experience; you can also offer fresh and valuable perspectives too! Don’t be afraid to contribute and share your knowledge, opinions and ideas.\nStay open minded, don’t limit yourself to one particular career path or area of the team. Most people’s career paths aren’t linear so be open to trying new things and developing new skillsets. So, say yes to opportunities!\n“Yes” has become one of my favourite words and has definitely opened more doors for me than I could have ever imagined. That being said, it’s important to know when to say no, and what meetings or experiences aren’t beneficial to you. Say yes to opportunities but don’t overwhelm yourself - it’s all about finding balance!\nTake initiative, stay busy, ask for things to do. Strive for excellence in all you do - you want people to remember you for what you’ve done and the fact that you’ve done it well. I’d advise you to set goals for yourself to give yourself direction and so that you know what you’re working towards and have clarity on what you want to achieve before the end of your internship!\n\nWe hope you found this interview with Mobolu Olowoyeye interesting. Her journey demonstrates how a passion for ethical technology and a drive to make a positive impact is building the foundations for a meaningful career, providing an example on how to combine technical skills with a commitment to public good.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Data Scientist working in Healthcare, you can read our previous ‘Interview with a Data Scientist’ with Amaia Imaz Blanco, The Data Scientist Who Just Wanted to Make Plots, on the NHS England Data Science Website.\n\n\n\n\nJuly Analyst X Data Science Huddle\n\nRecently, the Data Science Community for Health and Care organised a talk discussing the principles used in building the NHSRwaitinglist package, a package to apply calculations and principles from queuing theory to NHS waiting list analysis.\nMissed the session? Check out the recording and PowerPoint slides here, where you will also find the recordings of previous huddles.\n\n\nAnalyst X DS Huddle: Dual Project Showcase\n\n23rd of September 2025, 14:00 - 15:00, Online\nThe Data Science Community for Health and Care have organised the next AnalystX Data Science Huddle for September! The session will include two talks: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow, and Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare.\nAbstract: Simulation Modelling of Non-Elective Patient Flow\nPoor admitted non-elective patient flow is a major issue for many acute trusts. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a useful tool for modelling patient pathways. This project used DES to model patient flow for non-elective admissions. The model was used to investigate how reductions in inpatient length of stay, non-criteria to reside, additional escalation beds and fluctuations in demand impact waits for admission in ED. The model allows testing of ad hoc scenarios, via a user-friendly streamlit app, and has also been used to provide evidence-based targets for inpatient length of stay and informed discussions about relevant flow metrics. In this talk I’ll discuss the model, how it works and some of the insights from the project and happy to answer any questions or receive any suggestions you may have!\nAbstract: Probabilistic Linkage Pipeline Improving Linkage Quality and Explainability in Healthcare\nThe current methods used for data linkage or indexing in the healthcare industry follow deterministic algorithms that are not transparent to the end users and with often sub-optimal outcomes. Our work focuses on building and implementing a probabilistic algorithm that improves quality as well as explainability of the linkage. In this project we have used Splink, a UK Ministry of Justice probabilistic linkage Python package, to build a pipeline that links any health data set to the Personal Demographics Service (PDS), a dataset containing information about all patients registered to a GP in England, which acts as our linkage “spine”.\nWe have added this event to our Data Science Community for Health and Care calendar, where you can find the calendar invite to access the event.\nIf you would like to be invited to future events of ours, sign up to our mailing list!\n\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up! See the full calendar here, and a small selection below.\n\nAI and Defence for Maritime: Breakfast Briefing\nWednesday 17th September, 09:30 - 11:30, IET London: 2 Savoy Place, London,\nThe Alan Turing Institute’s Sustainability Mission is hosting a cross-cutting event with the aim to bring together a range of individuals across industry, government, and academia to discuss Artificial Intelligence (AI) in maritime. The focus of this event will be to break down silos, and foster communication across a diverse group of people (regulators, insurers, developers, users), and throughout the AI lifecycle. We will explore the current state of AI in relation to defence across the maritime sector.\nIf you would like to learn more about how AI can be used within the Maritime sector for defence, and how attackers can use AI against maritime technology, come along to hear from experts in the field and network with likeminded individuals over some breakfast!\nThis is a free workshop event and requires you to register your interest.\n\n\nBig Data LDN\nWednesday 24th - Thursday 25th September, All Day, London\nBig Data LDN is the UK’s leading free to attend data, analytics and AI conference & exhibition.\nThe two day event is a hub for the Data Community to learn and share best practice, build relationships and find the tools needed to develop an effective data-driven business.\n\nSee more future events on the calendar\nKnow of any events we should feature next month?

Many of us are very far from those positions, but it does not hurt to aim high. But also, it is good to know what is expected of our leaders. These are the six leadership competency domains that you can learn about reading the framework:\n\nDriving high-quality and sustainable outcomes\nSetting strategy and delivering long-term transformation\nPromoting equality and inclusion, and reducing health and workforce inequalities\nProviding robust governance and assurance\nCreating a compassionate, just and positive culture\nBuilding a trusted relationship with partners and communities\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

It’s not just industry software developers who are taking advantage of the tools it has to offer. Those who develop and use software for academic research are benefitting from them too. So how do you make the best use of generative AI for coding in a research context? As software engineers with The Alan Turing Institute’s Research Engineering Group (REG) and PhD Enrichment scheme, we’ve been asking ourselves just this question. Here, we share our thoughts, along with some tips for researchers.\n\n\nGitHub vs Gitlab Terminology Differences\nGitHub and GitLab are two very similar yet different platforms and that can lead to some confusion between teams who are familiar with one but not the other when some key pieces of terminology have been changed slightly between them. The RAP Community of Pracice have recently released a quick summary of some of these terminology differences. Read over this and you’ll never get your MRs and PRs mixed up again!\n\nStay tuned for an update on what seminars & show and tells will look like in the new team. Please bear with us as it is likely to be a learning process!
