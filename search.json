Many of us are very far from those positions, but it does not hurt to aim high. But also, it is good to know what is expected of our leaders. These are the six leadership competency domains that you can learn about reading the framework:\n\nDriving high-quality and sustainable outcomes\nSetting strategy and delivering long-term transformation\nPromoting equality and inclusion, and reducing health and workforce inequalities\nProviding robust governance and assurance\nCreating a compassionate, just and positive culture\nBuilding a trusted relationship with partners and communities\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nLots of exciting things coming up!

It‚Äôs not just industry software developers who are taking advantage of the tools it has to offer. Those who develop and use software for academic research are benefitting from them too. So how do you make the best use of generative AI for coding in a research context? As software engineers with The Alan Turing Institute‚Äôs Research Engineering Group (REG) and PhD Enrichment scheme, we‚Äôve been asking ourselves just this question. Here, we share our thoughts, along with some tips for researchers.\n\n\nGitHub vs Gitlab Terminology Differences\nGitHub and GitLab are two very similar yet different platforms and that can lead to some confusion between teams who are familiar with one but not the other when some key pieces of terminology have been changed slightly between them. The RAP Community of Pracice have recently released a quick summary of some of these terminology differences. Read over this and you‚Äôll never get your MRs and PRs mixed up again!\n\nStay tuned for an update on what seminars & show and tells will look like in the new team.

Data Science Discussions are a new event, focussed on peer to peer discussions on a broad range of Data Science topics. For this discussion Will asked everyone attending to research a future application of AI that interested them, and also consider how it could be later applied to healthcare. The discussion began with Will presenting his case: Project CETI, who are applying advanced machine learning and state-of-the-art robotics to listen to and translate the communication of sperm whales. Check out his slide deck here. We then broke up into smaller groups to further discuss his case and our own.\nThe Professional Development Functional Team hope to hold Data Science Discussions monthly.
